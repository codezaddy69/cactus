The thing is 4.6 is here, Opus 4.6. So I'm going to give you a complete master class here on how to use Opus 4.6
as a trader and there's actually an approach to trading that I believe in that is much better than going to
Trading View and buying and selling, putting charts, putting lines on the chart, etc. But the thing is is last
year we were at Opus 3 and then it was 35 and then it was 36 and then it was four and now it's 46. What's going to
happen next year? Do you think it'll be to five? What about the year after that? Do you
think we'll be on Opus 6? And then the year after that, do you think we'll be on Opus 7?
And then the year after that, do you think we'll be on Opus 8? Do you think each jump is going to be better and better? Amazon just reported that
they're spending 200 billion dollars on AI.
Um, all the other companies are spending 150 180 billion billion billion. So the
AI is going to keep getting better and better. So if you're a trader right now, what I want to show you is how to use Opus 4.6
in order to automate your trading. Come on. All those big heads out there at Wall Street, they don't want you to
know. They don't want you to know that you can actually do this. They're scared. They say, "Oh, you can't just use AI. You still need to go to
Stanford." Okay, that's fine. I've been locked for 5 years. In the first two, two and a half years, I had
to raw dog it, dude. I had to learn how to code.
I had to learn how to back test. I had to learn how to find ideas.
Then I had to learn how to build trading bots. But this AI just gets better and better. For the first two years, I was
getting dragged by all the gil foils in the chat. They're saying, "Oh,
AI can't actually do anything in a big project or this guy is just an
AI coder guy." But now they're all using cloud code. Why? Because they're realizing the AI is just going to get
better and better. And back when I was using chat GPT to copy and paste my code
over cuz I was 2 years in a junior dev. I saw it turn me into a better dev. I'm
a data dog. I follow the data. The data shows me okay. 2023 when they
launched Chad CBT, I became a much better coder. It it was much easier for me to research new ideas. It was much
easier for me to build back tests and code. And it was much easier for me to build trading bots. So, even if you
don't know how to code, I assure you, you can build anything now
because you have AI. If you have trash ideas,
you're going to have trash trading systems. I'll help you find ideas. I'll show you
how I'm going to use Opus 4.6 because it just keeps getting better and better and
better. every single month, dude. They're competing against each other. Gemini is
competing against Open AI. Open AAI is competing against Claude. And who is winning off that? That's us developers.
I wasn't a technical guy either. I didn't know how to code. I've been fooling around on my computer making
money for damn 15 years now. 16? No, 20
years. Damn. Damn. I'm I'm But I didn't learn how to code until I
was 30 cuz I had to automate my trading. So, I'll show you step by step everything here. I'll show you how to
find ideas using Opus 4.6 and by the time you watch this, it might be Opus 5.6. But guess what?
There's no better time than now to start because we are the ones benefiting from
all this competition between the mega corpse. The mega corpse are competing for us developers, us data dogs. Do you
understand that? Amazon just committed to spending $200
billion on AI. 200 billion. And that's one of the
companies. Oh, look at how many billions everybody else is. Microsoft, Google.
They're spending this money so they can build infrastructure or invest in open AI and thya yada yada whatever
whoever. It's money to AI. But look around. Who's getting off on AI right
now? The developers, right?
But you can be a developer starting today because you have AI to be the developer and you are just the idea guy. This is the time for idea guys. If
you're an idea guy that has been scared to learn how to code, I was scared too. I had to I had to automate my trading.
I was using way too much leverage, overtrading, getting liquidated, just like everybody got liquidated yesterday.
$2 billion in liquidations yesterday. Come on, dude. You can't trade by hand. I'll show you exactly how to find
strategies that your competitors are showing. They're showing their strategies. You just have to go see if they actually
work with your systems. I'll show you how to use Opus 4.6 in order to do that. Okay, let's do that first. But I also
want to show you how to go ahead and see if those strategies are actually profitable in the past.
It's called back testing. Back testing is the process of using
past data to see if your current strategy worked. If it worked in the past, that's a good signal. It's a good
signal. It's a better signal than putting some random lines on Trading View. I promise.
It's not perfect, but it's an indicator. So that's why the third thing I'm going
to teach you today is how to build a bot. How to build a bot that you can put
small size into and see if it works in the future. Because now by the end of today, you're
going to be able to use Opus 4.6 and then Opus 4.7 and then Opus 5 and then
Opus 6 and then CL Claude [ __ ] Phenom 10.2. I don't know what their names are.
Weird ass names. But at the end of the day,
Open AAI is competing against Anthropic. Google is also competing against OpenAI
and Anthropic. The prices are low right now. Yes, I know 200 a month for cloud code might be
heavy. Use a $20 plan. That's fine. But you have to realize all of these
prices are being subsidized by either VCs or big companies. Nvidia buying or
like funding OpenAI so they can build doing that whole loop-de-loop thing like some ponzomics going on. Amazon just
committed to 200 billion. Amazon throwing what they say 50 billion
at Open AI because Open AI needs to keep raising money or else the models are going to be too expensive for us to use.
This is like when Ubers used to be cheap. This is like when Airbnb used to be
cheap. The prices are low right now
because VCs and mega corporations are funding this because they see all of
their developers in their companies are now 10x developers. 100x developer. You
have a 10x developer back in the day. Okay, he's a 100x now. He's using AI. But the sad sad thing is, and this is
opportunity for you and I, those 10x developers from the past,
they're holding on. They're holding on. They're saying, "No, they AI can't do this. AI can't do that. Try a large
project with AI." Dude, I've been using AI since it dropped. Shipping every single day. And you log in and you see
me. You scroll through YouTube, you see me shipping all day with AI, and it's just getting better and better because that's my thesis. Okay. 2 3 years ago.
Chai GBT was cool. It could code. It could code better than me. Maybe I'm not a 10x engineer. That's fine. I became
one. It got better and better and better.
Cursor came out. Boom. Now we got AI in the in the browser. Wow. I could build
anything now. And Cloud Code came out. Game over, dude. And we're only on 4.5.
It's what's called machine learning. So you find
things that are predictive. You might guess, oh, such and such should be
predictive, might be predictive. And you test it out in the computer. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. You test it out on
long term historical data and uh price
data and other things. And then you add to the system this if it if it works. And if it doesn't, you you throw it out.
So there aren't elaborate equations, at least not for
longs got licked yesterday. Now shorts are getting licked. And you just heard Jim Simons. Jim Simons ran up a net
worth of $31 billion. That's who I'm chasing. That's why you see me here every single day because I've got a big
goal ahead of me. I'm going to do whatever it takes to get there. He ran up a net worth of $31
billion doing exactly what I'm showing you here today.
Think about that. Now it's starting to make sense why Wall Street and all the other quants, they're
mad at me. They're mad. You seen it on Twitter.
They're mad. They don't want me to show this. Okay, let's do private zooms only then. That's fine. I don't need to show
it on YouTube. I don't need to talk to people on the outside.
This is between me and Jim. And I got AI to power it.
me, AI, and Jim. And I am confident
the AI is going to get better and better and better.
Opus 4.6 is here. Opus 4.5 changed trading forever. You
think Opus 4.6 isn't? And then Opus 5.9. Come on, dude. I'll show you three
things today. Number one, I'm going to show you how to find ideas. Your competitors are literally giving you
ideas. I just I got to show you where to find these trading ideas so you can have great trading systems. But then I'm
going to go ahead and I'm going to show you how to see if those systems actually worked in the past. If they worked in the past, they might work in the future.
It's a better indicator than putting some lines on a chart. And you know that, dude.
Okay, that's your indicator. Now, back test. Okay, now you find some good back tests, things that worked in the past,
while it might work in the future. So, let's build a bot. But since it's not guaranteed to work in the future,
use small size. You know, when I first got started, I went locked in. I met somebody that was trading a billion
dollars a day. Looked like me. He was a bro just like me. He said, "Bro, like me." Okay, I heard of Jim Simons. That's
great, but he's super smart or something. But then you meet somebody in real life and it's like, okay, I can do this, too. So, I lock I locked in for
four hours a day and I learned how to code by hand. It's crazy. I don't code by hand anymore. And like I said, the
TED X engineers, the quants, Wall Street, they will all drag me for that, for being an AI coder. But let's see.
Let me do my experiment. I'm a scientist, too. Just test things. Throw things at the
wall. See what sticks. And this system I'll be showing you today of finding
great ideas. Number one, I'll show you that. Use Opus 4.6 for that.
This system, finding great ideas and then testing to see if those ideas work in the past
and then implementing into bots. If you're one of those people that's going to spend 6 months, a year, two
years on one idea, you're cooked. You're cooked. Drop the ego. It's hard. It's hard. It's
hard. It's hard to drop the ego and just be like, "Yo, my ideas are trash.
Let's just see what works. Let's test a bunch. Let me test a 100 ideas when I thought I would test five."
And I've learned this from experience. When I was 21, about to graduate college, broke broke as a joke just like
everybody else was. But I was on like an online thing and I clicked an ad and it had me join a a
training. Anyways, this guy was teaching me how to build iPhone apps without
knowing how to code. That was appealing cuz I didn't know how to code. I was a little bit of like internet entrepreneur
type, you know, eBay type things. So, I was like, "Yeah, I'm going watch that."
But at the end, he sold me a course for $2,000 that I
didn't have. I had to use a credit card. But I was so so
convinced that, hey, the app store is brand new. It's 2012 right now. I mean, I'm four
years late, but people are getting off. I have the the the examples here. Okay, I see people that are getting off on the
app store. I'm going to I'm going to go build an app because I don't need to know how to code.
But I put down $2,000 on a credit card. And guess what? I learned exactly how to
build an app. and I was able to build the app. Long story short, it was go to Upwork and hire developers to build an app that you think already has demand,
make it better. Find something with demand and make it better. Find something with demand and make it
better. What I'm going to be showing you today is how to find your competitor's strategies,
then make them better. Make them for your trading style. And
we're going to use Open 4.6, Open Claw. We're going to use it all, dude. you're going to see everything.
I learned how to build that app through the Upwork. I got rinsed. Spent 15K on my first app. I was hyping it up to all
my teammates. Like, I'm about to drop the next best game, Temple Run. I dropped it. All my teammates were like,
"This is trash." And what was worse is the market told me it was trash. I didn't make any money off the app. But I
built the infrastructure for something beautiful. I learned exactly how to build apps without knowing how to code.
I had a system and I had some code of an app. What if I
go ahead and I I uh test some different ideas based off this?
You know, obviously my idea was trash. Nobody liked it. Nobody downloaded it.
What if I test some other ideas? Okay, boom. 100 tests.
Long story short, I blew up after that. In a good way. In a very good way. I know blowing up in trading is a bad
thing, but blowing up in business is a good thing because I tested a hundred
different things and I found exactly what worked. I dove deep into that thing. So, a lot of people's natural
inhibition is to go ahead and dive into an industry and just focus all their time on one thing. And the story that
story was to kind of tell you, don't dive into one thing. Don't waste your time on just one thing. test multiple
ideas knowing that our our intuition, our ideas are typically trash and that's
why you're here. Let's be honest, because your trading ideas are trash,
too. You get licked. That's why these guys are showing up here.
So, it's hard, but I truly hope if you are going to
attack this industry with Opus 4.6, 6 4.9 whatever
that you throw a lot of spaghetti at the wall and then just follow the data.
Test ideas that maybe they're not yours. I want to show you
where your competitors are showing all their ideas and then show you how to have cloud code work with it.
Test test test. Follow the data, find a ton of ideas, back test to see if they
actually work in the past, and then build trading bots. Okay. How does Opus 4.6 or 5.15
fit into this? Well, what I've been explaining, the three steps, research,
ideas, that's R. Back test those ideas, that's B. And then implement them into
bots. That's I, RBI system. It's all you need to know.
and Opus 4.6 can be deployed to every single step.
So, let me just go show you how to deploy this. First things first, let's go ahead and get Opus 4 in here. Opus,
what number are we on? 4.6. Okay, let's go ahead here and say
model. Set model here. She's 4.6 already. Okay,
that was easy. I need to reset all of these then. So my flow here is to use
Opus through Cloud Code and Claudebot. That's
it. This is Cloudbot on another computer. You don't need a Mac Mini. I told you
how to do this. Go ahead and update our system. So we're on Opus 4.6. They just
dropped it. I'm actually not quite sure how we can do that, but you can do that. for for me on my computer. All I did was
restart Claude Code and it brought in Opus 4.6. But I don't know. You can figure it out probably, gang. Let's get
it. So, this is Claude bot, the thing that's going super viral everywhere.
Everybody's talking about it. I just want to use it because I'm a data dog and I'm not listening to what other people have to say if it's good or bad.
I got to test it. If I see a bunch of people talking about something, I'mma test it. I I'll give you the bottom line.
Opus 4.6 six was just released. Can you go ahead and update our system so we're using it? For me, I just had to restart
my Claude code instance on my computer. I don't know how you'll do it, though. Figure it out, please. Thanks.
All right. So, this is Claudebot here.
Claudia, Claudia, Claudia. We got so many clouds. We've got Claude
everywhere. I want to see if she can update it. And then I want to show you immediately
exactly how to find great ideas. Because at the end of the day, you're
sitting here going to make it. I just ain't know how.
But I knew this world is what you make it. You create your own environment. It all starts with a vision. What you can
imagine, you can create. What you can imagine, you can create.
At the end of the day, you're sitting here a hand trader losing money and I have proof of that. Everybody lost their
money yesterday um that was still trading. So, uh longs get licked, then shorts get licked, then longs get
licked, and shorts get licked. I have the math behind that. If you're using more than let's say 6x leverage, you are
going to get liquidated. So, I've got the math behind that and I've got the tests. I want to show you how to find or
build your own tests so you can prove that out for yourself. Take your actual idea, the way you trade right now, and
then be able to see if it actually works in the past and see how much of a draw down can it take. Because if the draw
down's too high
and you're using leverage, you're smoked.
10% draw down with 10x leverage is a liquidation. And it only takes one
liquidation to lose all of your money forever. And that's the sad part because I see it every single day.
You could see a 2 million short liquidation. Somebody decided to short yesterday when the markets were
crashing. Emotional decision. $2 million short, $1.87 million short liquidation this
morning. Somebody looked at this chart, looked at it. That is straight in his eyes. It's okay. This is what this guy
did yesterday. He said, "Okay." Oh, yeah. Okay. It's the market's crashing. Okay. Yeah. Market's crashing. I better
I better uh I better sell all of my Bitcoin here and then I'm just going to short here.
Yes. Yes. Or I'm going to short here. It was worse. He got liquidated. So, he shorted here, dude. And he got licked
right there. So, I mean, it's just as the Stanford professor said, I watched it on YouTube. Of course, I got held
back in seventh grade. I didn't qualify for Stanford. I'm not qualified to be a coin. yada yada. As he said,
when you're in emotional state, you literally cannot think logically.
So, when you're trading with that much leverage, you're usually not thinking logically.
And your fears of them stopping you out and hunting your liquidations. Yes, they are doing that. I hope you know that
because I even have access to that data now. I can see everybody's positions. I can see when everybody gets liquidated.
Speaking of that, since you did show up here to this private Zoom today, I am going to give you the API key access and
the quant app. Just a bonus here. So, if you do get in before the end of the
private Zoom, you're going to get the API key. You're also going to get coin app. So, you can
see everybody's positions. And I think this is going to be enlightening to you because you've had worries, right? Like,
"Oh, I feel like they're stopping me out or they're hunting me, yada yada." You're right, dude. They are hunting
you. Especially in a bare market. Cuz in a bull market, you can get away, you can
get away with just being mad bullish. In a bare market, longs get licked, shorts get licked. Longs get licked, shorts get
licked. So, I'm going to go ahead and get you that new key right now.
And I just want you to think about all the times people ask you, "What do you do, dude?" And you're like, "I'm a
trader." And they look at they're my Oh, another DJ and gambler.
But right now, from here on out, you are a quant. I have blessed you with quantness, dude. You are a quant
starting now. If you truly want to approach this industry using cloud 4.6, six, cloud 4.9, quad whatever, AI,
whatever. Using AI to code, do the hard stuff for you. The stuff that those quants, they value so, so much. They
don't want to give it up. They want to stay a 10x engineer. Well, guess what? You're a quant now and you're a 100x
engineer cuz you could have a 100 tabs with Claude going all day long. So, I believe in you, dude. [ __ ] them. And
let's get it. Let's get it, dude. You're a quant now. You can you can go
update your Twitter profile. You can go ahead and update your LinkedIn.
You are absolutely a quant now. If you are going to use data
to approach the market, you are a quant. You're not a trader anymore. And that's just going to change your life because
now when you tell somebody what you do, it's not I'm a gambler or sorry, I'm a
trader. It's not that anymore, dude. Not that anymore. You're a quant now. So,
let's get it. current state active stream key. The API keys has the same
key listed twice. Uh current here's the script how the script works. What are you doing gang? I gave you the script. I
gave you the script. Hey baby girl. So I I was just giving
you the script as a reference so you could go ahead and deactivate yesterday's stream key and create a new one. Thank you very much.
So I'm going to drop that key here. if you do get in before the end of the stream today. But I've got a lot to show
you and I'm doing a full robustness test here today of Opus 4.6. It's a lot of
hype right now, but you know, I just look at the hype and then I'm a data dog. I'll test the hype. Is it hype? Is
it as good as it people say it is? Or is it just another model? I don't know. I don't care. You know my thesis here. The
AI is going to get better and better and Google's competing for us. Amazon is making our lives better. We have a small
glimpse in this world right now where we're getting very inexpensive AI. I hope they can get the prices down in the
future because they are we're just burning VC cash. I say it every day.
We're just burning VC cash. So burn that cash, bro. This is our shot. This is our
shot. If you are a non-coder, unqualified, yada yada. If you approach
trading starting today, if you approach it with data, you are a
quant. So, nice to meet you, sir. Quant. Sure, Quant.
And if trading is not working for you today, then you must replace. You must replace it. You have two options. Stop
trading or approach it quantitatively because you are a quant now. So, let me go ahead and get all of these links
here. in the uh in the chat.
API key is being dropped right now. GMGM, good to see everybody.
I'm throwing the throwing it all in the chat right now. So, I've upgraded to Opus. Let's see the
model here. I think we're good. You can see the API key died. There's a new one. So, for the last few days, I've been
giving a API key to the Mundav API here for free for people that log in on the
Zoom. That's it though cuz this is like a very very expensive expensive set of data and
it's literally part of my edge. And we'll talk about that. We'll talk about it.
We'll talk about it and then we'll be about it. We're always going to keep stepping on the gas.
So, what I want to do here is make sure she's updated and then I want to get into I want her
to dive in. That's what that's how I'm going to show you all these things. Okay. So, I want and you have this road
map now because you came today. httpsmundave.comroadmap.
Please go investigate that road mapap here and hone in on the re research part. What
are the ideas? Tell me back the ideas of the research part. How do you find great
ideas? Now, especially using claude opus 4.6, six, we have all
everything laid out in that road map. So investigate it and then what I want you to start doing is taking action on some
of those research tips and come back with 50 great ideas that are directly
from the RBI system where I show people on that road map how to find ideas
because at the end of the day in order to be a quant you have to keep coming up with great ideas. Don't be one of those guys that just is spending all their
time obsessing over one idea unless the data shows you to do that. Got to find more and more ideas. So I want you to
come back with 50 ideas derived from the places that I show in the road map and
then teach back here using Opus 4.6
how anybody viewing should find great ideas based off of what I've written in the road map.
So, she should go start researching ideas. Now, I'm using Open Claw here
with Opus 4.6. So, we'll see.
We'll see, dude. We'll see. See what she can do. Let's see what she
can do. And then I'm actually going to do the same exact
prompt here. Well, I can't I can't copy and paste, but this is using 4.6. 6. So, this is good. Getting a little taste of
Opus 4.6 opposed to doing it just right in here. Um, I'm still like testing
OpenClaw. Um, there's a lot of hype there and I just want to use it for a while and see if it's actually better
than using Claw Code because the model is the trick, right? Imagine you had everything you wanted.
Everything. Imagine you were everything you ever wanted to be
and capture that feeling. That's the easiest way to manifest what you want.
Like the AI is the thing. It's cool to have this. I don't fully know how to do
the whole autonomous work for you all night thing. Um, so I think it's a little bit of hype still. That being
said, I'm going to keep just testing it because when I see hype, I just like to see it for myself. And that kind of goes
back to the whole research side of this. Remember what I'm going to teach you today is how to use Opus 4.6 6 to
execute the RBI system. The RBI system is actually shown in the road map that I gave to you and
she's researching it right now currently. She is an openclaw 4.6. But
this is really what I am going to be focusing my next decade maybe two decades to is the
process of automating is is algo trading but the process of
automating your trading it starts with the research of trading strategies that's R then you back test those
strategies see if they actually work in the past if they work in the past they're not guaranteed to work in the future but they're much more likely so
this is my framework that I follow and I want going to show you today how to use Opus 4.6 or any AI in the future, of
course, in order to expand on this. You can see I just set her off to go
research this page here because I've been teaching humans how to do this for
multiple years now and they've been successful. So, no offense
to humans or myself, but
I think that these AIs are better and smarter.
Anthony says he's not seeing anything. Can you guys see? Throw a one in the
chat if you can see the screen. One. One. Okay, so Anony's cooked.
Good to know. Good to know. Thank you guys. Thank you guys. So, she's investigating how to do the R right now
because at the end of the day, what I did is I thought I could just learn how to code and then be a billionaire
because I know how to code. I can build bots. But that was very naive thinking. So, I ran it put 10K into my first bot
without back testing it, without researching an idea. I lost that money. So what came out of that is this RBI
system and I think this has made back
it's it's an infinite amount has been made back based off that 10K because
there's literally hundreds of you that have followed this system to success.
So I want to show you today how to find these good ideas. She's taking a while.
So, while she's taking a while, if you actually want to automate your
trading, there is no excuse anymore. I didn't go to school as an engineer. I didn't I wasn't in the HFT firm. I was I
didn't go to Stanford. I didn't I got held back in seventh grade. yada yada, dude. Like, who cares? We all got all
the excuses in the world, but we have AI now. We've got AI.
So I want to show you a few places so you can leave here today just with some good notes of things you can then take
and attack this industry by yourself. The R is very important to me because remember like I said don't just go run
to the bot because once you learn how to code or you have the idea to automate your trading doesn't mean it's going to be profitable. You have to make sure
that they're profitable strategies. So there's a plenty of places to find great ideas. Google Scholar is a great one
because it has PhDs writing papers about trading strategies. So super easy to
find these papers. Go to Google Scholar here and remember you're you're trying to generate a ton of ideas, you know,
because we don't know which ones are going to do well, especially in your systems. You can type in trading strategy mean reversion. You can say
VWAP strategies, whatever you want. And there's going to be a gazillion papers
that you can read through, skim through, have AI look at
I've built AI agents that will go through and just research, research, research. You could do that, but it, you
know, it's it's level five. I think it's better to kind of learn this stuff as a human and then use AI as
your leverage. But right now, the thing is, the only time you're using leverage is on these charts. That's why you're
cooked. Oh, let's just do it a different way, right?
Just approach Let's just approach the markets a different way.
Anybody can do this. If you're a trader, you could do this. If you're not a trader, don't become a trader. It's too hard.
So, you've got unlimited papers. Just throw keywords in there. Any type of strategies you want to see. You can read all of these papers.
You can see exactly what your competitors remember that these are your competitors. A lot of these are traders.
So, take it with a grain of salt. There's nothing going to be there's not going to be anything plugandplay. Of course not. But just the idea of VWAP
like could be uh unlocked for you. You see what I'm saying? So, you got unlimited papers,
you've got pretty much unlimited books, but I've got some good books that I've read. Now, I haven't read every book in
the world, of course, but if you want to screenshot this or just take the road map, market wizards are essential.
Pretty much Jack Schwagger, he goes ahead and he interviews the best traders and he verifies that they're actually good traders. So, they're telling us
their strategies. Those that's your competition again, telling us their actual strategies.
take it with a grain of salt. Of course, are they going to give us the exact strategy? Probably not. But if he has
three, four books interviewing 10, 12 different traders in each, then shoot,
you got like 40 different traders that you can learn from, you can literally get their exact ideas.
That's an essential series of books to read right now. You want to dive into like HFT stuff, Flash Boys, but I think
there's plenty of alpha learning from these guys, real traders. Maybe they're not trading a thousand times per day,
and that's okay. It's another thing everybody wants to do is just trade like a billion times a day. The more you
trade, the less you have. You literally have to pay fees every single time that you trade. And most people don't even know that. They don't even know that.
They don't even know how chopped up their game by fees. Moonav.com/fees
calculator. You can check your fees here. But for example, this guy, if he would have used the bot, he would have saved $175,000.
This guy would have used a bot, he would have saved $116,000. If this guy would have used a bot, he would have saved $28,000. Why? Because
market orders are 3x as expensive as limit orders.
And as a human, you're going to use more market orders than limit orders. Look at this. If you have a $25,000 account size
and you're using 40x leverage, if you trade five times per day, you lose your entire account in 31 days just because
of fees. Not including emotional trading, not including nothing. No, it's
just fees. Just fees. Just buying and selling five times a day, leverage 40 with 25 account size. But if you had a
bot, you would extend your life 717 days. That's gamechanging. Don't you
think you could find something that works in two years?
I'm going give you all the sauce today. I'm give you all the sauce so you can go do it. Are you going to do it is the
question. Are you going to read these three books? Most won't. And that's okay
cuz remember trading is PvP. Player verse player. Person verse person. In
order to win in trading, you must take from somebody else. That's why New York, New York City, the funds out there, the
quants, they don't want me to teach this stuff because they need more chumps like you and I that's going to go ahead and
trade with leverage. You got market wizards definitely
screenshot this right now because these are some of my favorite books. And then the one other one I want to talk about
is actually a podcast because there's 300 plus traders interviewed here and again verified. So, it's very similar to
this verified maybe not as like these are absolute goat traders, but these
guys have really really great ideas and there's 300 of them and it's a podcast. I mean, I listen to the audible of this.
So, audio is away in my my opinion because you can do it wherever whenever.
Um, yeah. So, you have some good ideas here of how to get ideas,
how to find trading strategies. And what is she doing? You good, Shorty? You good, Shorty?
She's taking a long time. Oh, it's Q. Okay, she's working. I'm not going to touch her. I'mma let her slide.
I'mma let her slide. See what she can do. In the meantime,
I'll just tell you as a human how to do this. Dude, you got your trading books, you got your
technical books, and you got your mind books. This is moonab.com/map. You have access to this just for coming through today. So you can look at this
at your own time, but I need to highlight a couple things like where do you find ideas and how do you apply
cloud tool? Let's see if this cloud can do it better faster. So this is cloud 4.6 opus
moon.comroadap please analyze
I didn't I didn't do it correctly. road map. Please analyze this entire page and
specifically the R section of RBI, right? You just decide what it's going
to be, who you're going to be, how you're going to do it. Just decide and then from that point, the universe is
going to get out your way. It's like it's water. It wants to it wants to move and go around stuff, you know,
based on the instructions I show in that website. And then tell me how if AI
continues to get better over the next 10 years, how they can improve this process.
It's interesting, dude. I think that's a very interesting thesis. Like two years ago, bet the AI is going to be way
better than it is now. Like that's a simple thesis that any any big head can understand, right?
And that happened. Do you think it's going to slow down is the question. Because if you're still fading AI and
saying that I'm not I'm not a PhD. I'm a thousand PhDs now. You're a thousand
PhDs now. You don't need to go to school for that. No way. What? You're just going to go waste four year four years,
eight years? I don't even know how many years they have to do while we're locked using cloud code. Opus 4.6 and then it's
going to be 4.9 and then seven. And I'm just excited, dude. I'm excited and
I'm glad you found me because you found me somehow some way. I don't know how but I'm glad you're here because I saw a
lot of people get wrecked yesterday and I think there's going to be more today unfortunately.
But it might be the other side. It probably be both sides. You can see this guy also looked at the chart emotionally
yesterday and was like, "Let me short right here." And then he just blew up.
just lost $1.5 million. Leverage is a drug. It's not your fault,
dude. Just you don't have the correct way to approach the markets. The correct way to approach the markets, and I have
the data because I've back tested this. The only way to approach these markets
is to stop trading or to automate it. Because if you
automate it, you're forced to see the truth.
I haven't found a strategy that can use 40 50x leverage ever. Okay? So, if you're using 40 50x leverage, you're
you're just like wasting your time until you die. You know, wasting your time until you get liquidated. So, that's 5
years. Maybe there are some strategies that can trade with 50x 40x leverage. Unless you're hedge, you're not able to
do that. You're not able to do that.
Sorry, dude. It's heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking to think back that you've wasted your time staring at these charts, but you haven't. You haven't
wasted your time. You've learned some skills. You've learned some strategies. Now, you just need to know how to test them.
Oh, it's client side rendered. That's why they're sticking here. Okay. Okay.
Ah, that's why she's stuck over here. What a bad first example, dude. What a
bad first example. Let's go ahead and say stop then. My bad.
God, what a flop. My bad. On that first example is client side rendered or whatever is through notion, so it's
cooked. You can't look at that data. Here, I'll paste it here. What did she say, though?
Oh, so she fig the it out. How did she find it out? Here's what I gathered from multiple sources about
your RBI framework. The page itself is client rendered, so I
couldn't scrape it directly, but between searches, search results, the deep wiki
docs on your AI agents repo and the ALGO trade camp references. Here's a comprehensive breakdown. The R in the
RBI research step-by-step guide to finding great strategy
ideas. A core principle. Never skip straight to coding a bot. Yes, great core principle. Research is the
foundation that prevents you from losing money on on untested strategies. Where to find strategies? We got Google
Scholar. You got YouTube. You got Google. You're a good Googler,
but I mean I would use AI books. I showed you a bunch of books. You have that market data itself. Play
around with data. Test ideas. Sentiment onchain metrics. Cross exchange discrepancies. Okay. So, if you want to
get into arbitrage, that's fine. How AI can improve this process over the next 10 years. If you're in this game, only
get into it if you're you're long-term in this game. Jim Simons died at like 85
with $31 billion. You can tinker on your computer until you die.
And it's a vicious game. You see me every single day locked for three, four hours.
I'm just getting started. I'm just getting started, dude. Just
getting started. Automated paper mining. AI agents will
continuously crawl Google Scholar, Arvix, and SSRN to extract strategy
logic. Let's see if she can do that.
Hey, can you go ahead and scrape Google Scholar and Arvix and SSRN to
find the best strategies that have the highest probability of doing well in
automated systems and come back with 20 of them. See if Clawback could do that.
How do you even do this though? Okay, I'm going to set a new session because she's tripping.
chat.
I'mma do a full refresh. What's going on, baby girl?
Okay, come up with 20 of them. So, I just sent my Clawa on some mission here, some side quest, which is actually the
main quest, but she gave me that idea. So, so I already do that. I already have
agents that do this, but I want to see how Clawback can do it. Video, audio, transcription, extraction. Okay, I
actually have something that does that already. So, I'm two years ahead of the AI. But it's only because I have AI.
Give me the confidence that I can literally build anything for the rest of my life. Just a confidence gang.
I know you're confident. I know you believe in yourself. I believe in you. Synthetic strategy generation LLM will
generate entirely new strategies strategy hypothesis by combining elements from multiple known strategies.
What if we combine OFI signals with liquidation cascades and a mean reversion exit? This is combatorial
creativity. Humans can't match at scale. Auto back testing pipelines. Research
flows directly into automated back testing with zero human intervention.
Regime aware research. Continuous literature monitoring.
Eliminating overfitting automatically. Automatically. Automatically. Damn.
See here what's going on over here.
So, I can see everybody's positions and I was looking at hype, but now I'm looking at everybody's positions. You
can see there's a BTC a couple BTC shorts up here. 3% 4% 4%. Anybody huge
though? Looking for the big Where's the whale? Where are the whales at? Where are they sitting? So yeah, your thought of everybody being able to see your
positions is true, but only us data dogs can actually see your positions and Wall Street and the exchanges short the
bottom 1.3 million here. Okay, but he's been successful thus far. There's a 455K
position here waiting to get licked. Okay, 5 million here. That's 3.5% away.
So we already did a lot of damage down. think it's going to be easier for them to push it up and get these guys. But I
don't know. We'll see. We'll see. See, we'll see. We'll see. I don't
predict price because I know I can't. I just have to build ideas into systems
that have success in the past, but the past isn't guaranteed to be the future.
So, I test with small size and I scale up. Tesla small size and scale up. Tesla
small size and scale up. I feel like I have explained how to find ideas, how to
use AI, how to use Opus 4.6 enough. You know where the papers are. You know
where the books are. You know the podcasts. Um, you know I use Claude
Code. I don't use cursor anymore. Why do I use Claude Code? Why is it through the terminal? Because it's sicker. It's just
I know it's gross if you're brand new.
I get it. Scary. Scary, dude. But what's more scary?
Learning how to code, learning how to use AI to build bots, or losing all your money trading with emotion? What's more
scary? A lot of people don't know this, but it
absolutely changes everything once you understand that, hey, I can be a trader. I just I can't drive the car because I'm
not a good driver. Okay, we got automated driving and then people are still trading by hand. I don't get it. I
don't get it, dude. And the thing is is even if you're a complete beginner, I can show you a great quote that said
rest at the end, not in the middle. That's something I always live by.
I'm not going to rest. I'm going to keep on pushing. Now a lot of answers that I don't have, even questions that I don't
have. I'm just gonna keep going. I'm just gonna keep going and I'll figure these things out as you go. Right? You
just continue to build that way. So that I try to live by that all the time. Rest at the end. Rest at the end.
Rest at the end, baby. Rest at the end. You're not going to stop trading.
Unfortunately, you should. If you're not going to stop trading, then you have to automate it because
your emotions are going to get in the way. And they just need to get in the way one time.
So you crank up that leverage or add to a losing position and then you're licked.
So if you're brand new, you've never coded before, I can help you. But if you've already learned how to code, that's great. You're just ahead.
You're just ahead. It still comes down to great ideas.
So I've shown you how to find great ideas, great strategies that your competitors are literally giving you. So
go after it. Get after it, dude. Let's go. It's time to go.
It's time to go. It's time to get into the weeds. The weeds. The weeds.
We got to start back testing things. See if it actually works in the past.
Cuz we have a list of ideas. Now, I don't know about you, but I sit and listen, read, listen all day. Audible.
Audible. But I can call that reading, right?
I come up with ideas and I write them in my notes. My iPhone notes have a lot of ideas,
a lot of ideas. And then I come back here and I see if those ideas work in the past. Now, just a warning if you are
new here, a lot of people are going to be showing you trading view back test, but there's something called over paint
or repainting repainting and that happens a lot on Trading View. So definitely do not use trading view to
back test. Do not use trading view to back test.
What do you use then moan to back test? There is a library and
that's just like an app for python called
back testing. PY and actually on that road map I do give
you access to some actual code that I literally use in order to back test. Now
this took me a long long time to build so I'm glad you found me somehow and I'm glad I'm about to give you the
code for that right now. So let's go back to that road map here
and you can see the RBI system is back testing is the next thing right
research and then back test see if it actually works in the past
works in the past it might work in the future okay great if it works in the future scale it
up but start small start small not like those other guys that's just
going to hype it up and be like build a bot make a billion dollars you're not going to do that. You're not going to do that right away, dude. You have to build
your edge. So, I want to at least give you a system. I can't I'm not a financial adviser. I can't give you a strategy. I can't give you a bot to run.
Just can't do it. It's too much risk. I'm already risking enough showing this all. I've literally built my edge here
showing every I've shown everything. It's crazy. That's crazy. Crazy crazy. I
have a vault that you have access to literally every single stream, every video I've ever released, everything
I've ever built over the last 5 years. There's two terabytes of videos in here.
I've done enough. I'd rather give you a system so you can
eat for the rest of your life because I think you're going to keep trading, right?
Remember, you have two options. If you're a hand trader, stop trading or automate it. Because if you automate it, then you're forced to go through a
system like this. And what actually happens? Okay, you're a quant now, right? So you go from trading
emotionally every day, waking up, losing money, making money, making money, losing money, making money, dancing,
losing money, crying, okay, you change that lifestyle for one
where you're actually spending your your four, six hours a day, however much you work, spending it on finding great
trading strategies. So you're listening to books, you're you're you're reading papers, you're absorbing smart people's
ideas, you're writing those down. So you just replace a bad habit which is gambling which is a sin
with a good habit with which is researching which is learning. Learn baby learn so we can
earn baby earn. That's what MLK Jr. says learn baby learn so we can earn. Yes he
got after the bag dude he got after the bag.
Learn baby learn so you can earn baby. Earn,
learn, baby. Learn so you can earn, baby. Earn.
Taking a bad habit, a sin, gambling every single day with your life savings, 40x leverage, replacing it with a good
habit, education, learn, learn, learn. So then you can take those ideas and
then back test them. Okay, so let me show you the code for this back test. It's literally a template that took me
years to build. Years of testing, dude, because I tested all of the back testing libraries, all of them. So, copy this
code. And I'm I feel okay giving you guys code of back tests, right? Because
you're not going to just go run my bot. You can't. This is a back test. This is to see if it actually works in the past.
So, you can copy this and you have the road map as well, but use back testing. That's my suggestion. I'm not a
financial adviser, but I tested all of the other libraries. I've tested thousands of ideas,
and this is the template I literally use with Opus 4.6.
Go ahead and build me or start five here. Let's do this in the GitHub. Let's do this in the other GitHub. I have a
GitHub with my trading bot stuff. Look at my
JAN folder. Actually, it might we might even have a Feb folder now with some ideas on it. Um, I have some ideas about
these liquidation trading systems and we wrote an MD about it. Yeah. Anyways, I want you to go ahead and use this back
testing template code here that Mundav gave me on his road map and I want you
to test out 10 different ideas based off of those liquidation ideas. But the only thing, okay, actually I
want it to be 20 different ideas and launch 10 agents. So we have 10
parallel agents working on two ideas each and they all have to use some of
those liquidation ideas that are written in the MD.
But we need variations with double confirmations because there was some idea that we crossed
with this liquidation data that was about double confirmations before
actually entering. So that will be the one tweak that every single one of these agents will go ahead and implement based
off of our winning ideas and then send me back the actual stats in a table
format so I can analyze the sharp ratio, the sortino ratio, the draw down, the
ROI, the EV. Did you hear that, dude? Did you hear those stats? You might need to rewind
because people always ask me, "What do you look for in your back test?" So I
give her this code again. Let me copy this code here. Copy this code. And this
is why I am so confident that any trader can do this. Damn, dude. Not it. But
wonder why that didn't copy. Oh, I have to do it again.
Right click to and copy the link. What the heck? Let me just copy it this way.
So, this is all of the code here. This is the code I use to this day. So, literally, this is a five-year gift here
because it took me 5 years to get to this point that I'm at today. And I want to show you everything of how you can
use Opus 4.6 in order to automate your trading. Even if you don't know how to code,
I've been through Trading View back tests. They are the absolute trashest. Do not use Trading View. I've used Back
Trader. I've used VectorBT. I've come to backtesting. And this is the legit template I give you. I'm now launching
10 10 different agents here to test ideas that I have. I've built an edge
off of. So, it takes time, right? Research, research, research, back test, back test, back test. Now, you have your
own ideas. Nobody's going to give you a plug-and-play bot for the same reason that a million dollars would not last very long if you told somebody or a
hundred people the exact location. If you told somebody the exact location
of a free million dollars, how long would it be there?
How long would it be there? Nobody's going to give you a bot that's
profitable. I'm sorry. You'll see videos around like ads and say say like, "Get
two, three ETH a day or something. Just download this bot. You're about to get liquidated. They're about to steal all
your money." I'll first explore your codebase to find the JAN feeb folders and the liquidation
ideas. Then I'll set up 10 parallel agents. Found your liquidation research. Let me read the key MD files to
understand these strategies and then find the data files. Excellent. I have a comprehensive
information. I have comprehensive information of your liquidation strategies. Let me find the data file
and read one of the existing strategies to understand the structure. Then I'll
launch 10 parallel agents with two strategies each. So I've got 10 opuses
going right now. We must keep moving. We must keep going.
If you can't fly, run. If you can't run, walk.
If you can't walk, crawl. But by all means, keep moving.
So, she's launching 10 agents. That's fun. It's very fun. And you can do this
starting today. It's 20 bucks a month for quad code. I'm on the $200 plan, but
again, that's because I've I've spent the money on developers. I told you the story about hiring developers.
I spent probably 500,000 plus minimum. So,
I was on apps that I didn't need to be the coder for. I tried to code many times probably just like you, dude. And
you just churn, you churn, you churn. But once you have a problem that you have to solve, like me, I had I had to
solve this. I was getting liquidated too much. Just like everybody's getting
liquidated right now, yesterday, today, every day, longs get licked, shorts get licked because the math, if you look at
the math on these trading strategies, you'll see like, okay, I'm about to have 20
different back tests here for you. And you can see I haven't coded once yet, have I?
Oh, this is the generation of the idea guy.
If you are one of those idea guys that actually steps on the gas, you can see back tests are uploading here or popping
out here. One had 139% return. This one had 103% return. So these are just
cooking, dude. We're just cooking. But I'm not coding. I'm not coding.
Okay, there is one good part of Trading View and I'm going to show you that right now. Lock in. This is a hack. You
can go to indicators here. You can go to editor's pics top whatever and they all
of this all of these indicators give you the actual code. So this is
just a quick tip. Quick tip. This one had a 99% return because I don't like
trading view as a place to back test. I think it repaints. I think the returns are too good to be true and they never
match up to Python. And I've done all the testing. I learned pine script. I learned the coding language to do that. You can see this is a 314% return. This
one is 158% return. But this is the one thing I really love about Trading View
is that they force all of their developers to put the code out. So we have their code. We've got their
exact code for every single indicator in the world. And I can just say or in the on Trading Views platform. I can paste
it in here and give them the road map I've already given you.
or the uh back test back testing py code. I give her the indicator plus the
code and I can literally back test anything without having to know how to code. And now you know that. So I'm just
trying to transfer some tips here along the way so you know everything I know about automated trading and you can do this yourself because I believe in you.
I believe if we the ones that are quoteunquote unqualified,
we attack together, we could take on Wall Street, dude. I
know we can. It's us versus Wall Street, so let's get it. They're going to tell you that you can't. And I'm going to
tell you that you can't. But now you legit know how to find great
ideas. And now you can see these back tests are outputting. But I didn't code anything.
just showed you I use Opus 4.6. Now the learning curve is getting over the fear of the terminal,
but I'll show you everything. It's not that hard. You see, I'm just t I'm typing in my ideas. And you might be
asking, what am I using to talk to the AI? It's this thing called Whisper Flow.
Whisper Flow. I just hit the Fn button and I'm able to
talk to it. Hey, hey, hey. So, when I was learning to code five
years ago, I didn't know how to type either. I was typing at like 30 25 words
per minute. And in order to learn how to code, I had to watch 15 different
courses while I was a day locked in. Dude, I'm not playing. I'm not playing
about my money, bro. I'm not playing about that. I'm sorry. from trading emotionally losing money. I have to find
a different way. I couldn't get off the charts. It was an addiction straight up.
It was an addiction. I knew I wasn't going to stop being a trader, so I had to just approach it a
different way. And now my life is so much better. Look, 27% return.
100% return. So, they're cooking. We've got 10 agents cooking the back test for you. The hard part. The part they they
don't want you to know about. You can do this, too. Yes, dude. you can do this
and I know you can because I was able to do it and I didn't I didn't know how to code either. I was scared to learn how
to code. Let me go ahead and grab the API keys again because I see some new people jumping into the Zoom. We do
private Zooms only. Those are the people I talk to. You can ask any questions you have. We'll be answering everything at
the end of the day always. And here's the API keys. You can see
this one has a 5,000% return. Lots of trades though.
So, what I want you to do is don't get too hyped on really great back tests. Use it as an indicator, a better
indicator than you sitting at the charts putting lines on.
The only way to trade is a quantitative approach to it because
I've I've been showing you the process, right? And this takes you from stressed out,
anxietyfilled trader trying to predict price to quant researcher day zero, day
one today. And then you'll be able to back test just like I'm able to back test. You could probably get this set up today.
Showing you all the sauce, bro. All of these sauce.
Cuz I believe code is a great equalizer. I believe code is a great equal life.
That's it. I see the power I have now just because I learned how to code. I could use AI.
Others can't. Others can't build with AI. You learn how to code, you can use
AI. I'll show you how to code.
So, I'm still waiting on these 10 agents here to finish up. I want to see if she can find some other great ideas because
about 3 4 days ago, we found some groundbreaking breaking ideas with these liquidations and now I just want to see
if 4.6 can take it to the take it to the next level.
GM GM
GM GM GM GM
I'm just sipping coffee. Let's see if there's any big liquidations coming up here. We got BTC
451 451K. So, these are actually closer now. So, we must be pushing down a bit.
So, you know everything, bro. You know exactly how to do this. You know how to research and back test. And if you stopped right now, this would be a much
better way of trading than than trading by hand. You could just stop right now at the R and the B. You could feed, you
could sell your ideas, sell your back test. And then you go from unprofitable hand trader to quant researcher that has
actual data on what works in the past. You'll never have to trade again. But if you want to follow me to the eye, if you
actually want to chase Jim Simons, he ran up a bag of 31 billion. I don't need all that. So I'm going to show
everything every day. And they hate that I show this. Wall Street hates it. Quants hate it. So I'm I'm doubling
down, dude. I'm doubling down. I'm trying to be more clear. I'm trying to I'm trying to teach more. I want to I
want to teach more people that were in my situation losing money. I want to teach them how to become a profitable
automated trader because I see it every single day. So, if this makes people mad, that's awesome. That's what I want.
I'm an underdog. If anybody's ever told you you can't do something in your life, let's get them.
Let's show them. Let's just show them. Let's just show them. Dude, you can see
she's done here. So, we've got 10 20 different back tests. You can see this one had a return of 152. The sharp was
15.8. So, these are the metrics I like to look at. Return, sharp, sortino, max
draw down, win rate, trades, and EV. EV must be over.2. Sharp ratio over one
minimum. This is 15. Sortino over like three. Max draw down. I like to see a
max draw down of half of the return. So you can see this is actually disgusting.
This is actually a disgusting trading strategy.
Wow, dude. Wow. Top seven strategies with sharp over nine ready for
robustness testing.
We must keep moving. We must keep going. If you can't fly,
run. If you can't run, walk.
If you can't walk, crawl. But by all means, keep moving.
Yeah, this is fire, dude.
Fire, dude. Fire, fire, fire. These sharps are actually I'm I'm boggled by these. I'm boggled by these. 15 sharp.
Are you serious? So, this is news to me. This is brand new. 4.6. 6. Dude, Opus 4.6 absolutely cooked.
Absolutely cooked. This is the first time I've ever seen Opus 4.6, mind you. It was released yesterday. So, you
actually have as many development skills as I do. That's the thing. If you're
using these models, you're becoming better and better, courtesy of Amazon, courtesy of Google, courtesy of Open AI,
courtesy of Nvidia, courtesy of all these billion dollar trillion dollar companies. They're paying for this.
They're building the infrastructure. They're betting on the AI future. Is it a bubble? For sure,
for sure. But if if you're not in a bubble, you better [ __ ] find one. That's what a great man once told me.
Don't be one of those bubble haters now. You better find one, buddy. Because this bubble is taking off. And now I'm a 100x
engineer. I was a 10x yesterday. Now I'm 100x because now I seen a 15 sharp. Are
you kidding me? I've never seen that before. I've never seen a 12 sharp.
Yeah, she cooked. She cooked on this one, dude. She cooked.
Wow. I'm just I'm just a little in awe. So, looking at this data here, you can see the return 152% but the draw down's
only 1%. That is insane. That's why the sharp is so high.
Consecutive licks plus calman here. 583 583 12.04 sharp 11 sharp 10 sharp 10
sharp 10 sharp. Yeah, I would say she's cooking. I would say if you're fading AI still, you're cooked.
Oh, AI can't take on big projects. AI can't do this. A million context length
now. Yes. 4.6. Thank you. I'm better now.
Just lock in every single day. Follow Jim or follow the crackhead hand
traders and lose all your money. Whatever.
I'm trying to show you everything, dog. In one stream, one stream, I want to show you absolutely everything. I've
already shown you how to find great ideas. I've given you the literal code so far on how to back test those ideas
to see if they work in the past. You have Opus 4.6 the same day I do. Let's
get it, dude. I believe code is a great equalizer. That's why I'm giving everything for
free, bro. I want you to see everything every day.
It's actually not free anymore. It's $5. $5 to get into the Zoom, dude. Cuz my
ops are in the public and I don't care what they have to say.
If you can't afford five, I literally don't want to spend my energy talking to you or listening to anything you say or
processing it in my brain. No way. It's me, Opus 4.6,
and Jim Simons. Get it?
And everything I learned, I'm passing to my team, my squad, the people in the
Zoom, the people in the Discord, everybody else. Get licked, bro. Get
licked. Literally, get licked. I'm literally hunting you every single day.
I watch everybody's positions and everybody in the Zoom is watching
everybody's positions because they all got the Quant app. They all got the API. Yes, it's just for a day, but hey, it's
a it's got to be a,000 plus dollars for this per month per se.
So, this is like a $12,000 gift divided by 365 days. So, you do the math.
I'm in awe here, dude. I'm in awe. Common filter combination dominate four
out of seven. Use the common DC08, DC11, DC03. How did I figure out what
the common filter is? First off, the R. The R. Actually, the R. I
literally I literally show you what I follow each day and I have the proof over a thousand videos that I've just
been locked in for four hours a day. A non-coder didn't know how to code. I had
a big problem. I was trading with leverage. I was trading too much. I was getting liquidated. I was losing all my money. I had to approach the markets a
different way. I met a dude. He was smoking a joint, sitting on the couch, windows open, air conditioning on,
and that's when it clicked. I can do that, too. He's trading a
billion dollars per day. I wonder what he's trading now. That was 5 years ago.
Did he help me? No way. Of course not. This is a scarcity-led industry. And the
only reason you are here is because you see, I don't give a [ __ ]
I will share everything. I'll show share everything. Dude, I
believe code is a great equalizer. I'll show you everything I know. And I've shown that for over a thousand videos of
over a thousand days. Over what have you done for a thousand days? That's the question.
Cuz if you're really serious about this, you have to lock in for a,000 days.
But if you think you're going to be trading for the next thousand days, wouldn't you rather have a robot trade for you?
Of course. Then you can actually spend your time moving forward. Because the thing about trading, you're not compounding. You're just staring at the
screen, staring at the charts. It's not compounding. You're staring at the charts, guessing the price is going to
go up or down. But me, I'm over here building back tests. I just built 20 of them.
I remember the day I found my first back test. Found my first winning back test. I was eating some eggs and some bacon out here
in PR. A little coffee, too. Enjoying my eggs and bacon with my
computer right next to me. Tinkering away, coding by hand. just slaving over that coding by hand stuff. Dude, it was
hard. It was hard. I had to learn how to code. I was scared to code my entire life. I was so scared. I paid nearly a
million dollars to Upwork de developers. That's how scared I was.
But once I met that dude, I was like, "Okay, I can do this, too. I'm lock in."
Sitting there coding by hand, back testing things, barely knowing how to code, but figured out how to get some
back test to go through. I found a winner. I [ __ ] bounced. so quick. I don't even know if I paid.
I ran home. I was so excited. But that was like two, three days of
work. Two, three days of work. And not better than most of these strategies here. It would be like the number 14th
on the list maybe. But she just cooked this for me. We are four, five years
later, but we have AI now. So, she cooked 20 of
them that are almost all better than that one that got me so excited. So, if you think you're too late, you're not.
You're right on time. 4.6 just dropped today. You got it the same day I got it. And you literally have the smartest
brains in the entire world trying to figure out this AI problem. How to make AI better and better so our developers
can code faster and faster. But you don't even have to be a developer anymore. You're already a quant. I hope
you changed your bio, dude. Please do tag me on Twitter when you do change your bio. I would love to see it
cuz you're a quant now. You're approaching the markets differently. You're not you're not at the charts right now. The market just opened.
Literally, it's 9:30 a.m. and you're not even looking at the markets. You're looking at data back tests that I am
shocked about because we have open 4.6 and it just got better. I've never seen sharps like this. Dude,
I've successfully shown you already how to find great ideas and how to back test them. How to have AI do this way faster.
I've I've literally built 20 back tests today and each one of them would have taken me at least eight hours.
At least 8 hours. So, I could quit for the rest of the day. I could be done. I'm an hour and a
half in and I could be done with my day if I'm comparing it to Mundea five years
ago. But that's the thing Jim Simons always tells me. He says, "You got to make your
systems better and better because that's what everybody else is going to do. But remember who we're competing against. We're competing against hand traders,
number one. They are easy to take their money from because we can see their positions. The quants are the tough
ones. The Wall Street guys, they're the tough ones. But guess what? They're so smart.
They don't need AI. You see it, dude. You see the comments, the backlash against AI. AI can't do
this. AI can't do that. Oh, it's too big of a project for AI. Boom. We got a million context level now with Opus 4.6.
So, they're low-key chumps, too, because that would have taken them, even if they're a great developer, each one of
these would have taken them at least a couple hours. So, let's let their egos do their thing. They're great coders. We
don't want to take that from them. They could do it that way. I'mma do it this way.
Top seven strategies. These are absolutely mindblowing. I've
never seen results like this. Wow.
I like to hype my AI up. I like to hype her up because she she's like
she's the edge, bro. She's the edge. She can build anything. Anyways, let's go ahead and launch seven
agents. One agent will actually you go ahead and make the plan for robustness testing. Do multiple like out of
samples, uh, permutations, Monte Carlos, things like that. Make a a plan for that
and then launch seven different agents to do it across our top seven and then
report back a nice table like this with all the same data uh, with the
robustness tests. Now, I don't I know you're just new to algorithmic trading. I keep it stupid simple.
Research, back test, and implement. Research, back test, and implement. That's all you got to worry about. This is just a nice easy step to verify your
back tests are actually good before going to live. Remember, research, back test, implement. That's the simplest way
to think about this. But when you back test, there are flaws with back testing. They can be overfit. Over fit means that
it's almost can see data and it's just it's seeing the data before it actually sees it and then it just fits it to the
data. But I don't want to I don't want to blow your brain up with all these intricacies here. Research back test
implement. If you go from hand trader, trading by hand with leverage, and then you move into a researcher, a back
tester, you're already more profitable immediately and your life is 100x better because
you're not stressed out trying to predict chart, predict prices when literally longs get licked, shorts get
licked, shorts get licked, longs get licked. We can see everybody's positions.
Everybody in this zoom right now can see everybody's positions. You're playing in a casino and they know
you're going to lose. So just already today in the first hour,
you've transformed yourself from a hand trader, emotional trading with too much leverage to a quant. So congrats.
Keep it simple. Research back test implement. You want to add in this robustness testing? Yes, of course. It's
just going to make it better. It's just going to make your bots better.
I do want to get to the point here today where we are able to build a couple bots
as well because then I'll be able to show you that's the full system. That's the full system in one day. And I know
you know my videos can be a little long but I think this is a very powerful system that I need to I need to show you
every step of it. So now you're a hand trader and by the end of or actually
right now you can already be a quant and be a researching and back testing quant partner with somebody that has money
that wants to trade if you want to do that. You can sell the data to people the back test. I have a bunch of ideas
that here's a bunch of back tests that actually work or you're a trader. Okay. Boom. Boom. I can help you implement it or you can trade your own capital. I
know a lot of people are struggling with capital right now. I saw over $2 billion liquidated yesterday. I'm sorry if that
was you. But if you're here today, then you know the universe has wild ways of
teaching us our lessons and getting us to learn what we need to learn.
So I'm excited. I'm excited to do some robustness testing here and then I want
to go ahead and actually build out a couple bots now. So, I've showed you how to research and back test. And now I
want to go ahead and build a couple bots. And the thing about the people around me, the quants around me, we can
code and build for any platform, any platform,
because I got everybody caught up to speed with me. Over the course of five years, I've shown how to build on
Hyperlquid in 2023, how to build onchain Solana in 2024,
how to build Poly Market in 2025. If you're on my team, you can build on
Coinbase, Bidance, Hyperlquid, Extended, Poly Market, Solana,
because you're actually locked. And I'm actually locked. I got I got four hours a day minimum. Minimum minimum two
terabytes. Let's get it. Show you everything. I
don't care what others have to say. 777 to you. That's spreading love. You stay in a positive mindset.
If you are kind to people, if you give more than you take, just energy wise,
you're going to have a better life. If you're in a good vibration, you can literally have anything in this world.
You can have anything in this world.
You can have anything.
Now, I do get a question here is just before we get to before we get to building the bot
because I have a couple bots I want to build here today. Got them on my list. Let's go here. You can see the whole
checklist I will be going through. Essentially, risk is the most important thing. So, after we find a strategy that
works in the past, you can go ahead and build that into something in the future. I've got a couple ideas that have uh worked relatively in the past, and I'm
going to build them into the future. I'm going to let these seven agents cook on the back test, but I'm going to switch on over to another uh exchange. And like
I said, we know how to build on any exchange,
but implementing risk controls is the number one thing. Implementing the strategy, of course, how do we enter? I would recommend limit orders because you
save 3x every single time. It's 33% cheaper than using market orders.
Got to check the position to see if there's a position already. A lot of people will get smoked here. They'll just they'll start their first bot and
they'll just buy and then not realize that they bought and they'll buy more and more and it'll just loop forever.
So, this is just a checklist you can look at later, but it's something that I will follow as well. One thing I do get
questioned a lot a lot on is you how do you run your bots? Do you run them on a computer? or do you run them on a server? And you
can see I have a bunch of bots running here. Got bots. I'm testing all types of bots here. So, I run them on my computer
while I'm incubating them. Incubating is testing with small size. It's kind of what the eye is. Implement, incubate,
whatever you want to call it. I need to just make the change to incubate because it's all about testing
with small size because you don't know if your main indicator is actually going to work in the future. Everybody else is
going to be like, "Oh, look at this back test. I made a billion% and now I'm a billionaire. It's like, no, not really.
It worked in the past, but the market's different in the future. Let's see if it actually works in the future by testing
tiny size. Does that make sense? Does this throw a one in the chat if this is making sense? Why it's so much better to
go from a hand trader to an automated trader that focuses their time on researching
and back testing to see if things work in the past. And if they work in the past, test with
small size because it's not always going to match up. I'm trying to give you the truth here, not some like hype. Not some
hype, dude. Okay, cool. Cool. Cool.
So, after when I scale these, I'll put them on a what's called a VPS, but I
don't want you to your eyes to glaze over here. Uh VPS's are essentially cloud computers just like your computer,
it's just as easy as using your computer, but you're using it on Amazon's servers or something. Uh so if
you don't have a super fast computer, you don't need a fast computer for this. You just need like probably 8 GB
of RAM. But if you live on an island like I do and you need to run it in the
cloud, very very easy to do it. I show you exactly how to do that. People like Hatsner, people like Digital Ocean,
people like Amazon, of course, Fur. I use Cherry servers, but they're all kind of commodities at this point. So, let me
go ahead and make sure the API keys are in the chat.
And you can see she's cooking on these robustness tests. I'm very excited about those. But I also have this idea that I
want to execute today. Actually, a couple ideas. So, let's go see here if I can find
that. Okay, here we go.
And then I want to go find those bots. Let's close some of these tabs. These
are all back tests that she did. You saw the final results from them. This is how to get the code from any
indicator on Trading View. This here is um
one bot I'm running. And then this one is a copy bot and it keeps dying on me.
So, I'm going to go ahead and relaunch that. This is the Salana stuff. Again, I run a a ton of different bots. Um that's
another secret for you. A lot of people think that getting in this industry is about finding one bot that can make you a billion dollars, and that's not the
way to go. It's better to have multiple strategies that may not be correlated. Meaning, hey, if the market is moving
just straight up or straight down, well, maybe you have a strategy that works well there, but it doesn't work well
when it's going sideways. Well, they'll kind of offset each other. And that's that's a super big alpha that took me
probably two to three years to understand. Like, hey, it's not just about having
one bot, like a billion dollar bot.
It's about having uncorrelated systems that work together to make you buddy in any environment.
Okay, so this is on account one. Actually going to kill that one for now.
We must keep moving. We must keep going. If you can't fly,
run. If you can't run, walk.
If you can't walk, crawl. But by all means, keep moving.
Keep moving, dude. Keep moving. Even if you got hit yesterday, just keep moving. If you can't run anymore, that's
okay. Walk. If you can't walk anymore, just crawl. Just keep going, dude. Just keep going. I had so many people tell me
once we got into a bull market, they're like, "You're the only reason I made it to this bull market because you locked in every single day. This is our
opportunity. If you got hurt yesterday, I am very, very sorry for you.
And I'm happy that you're here. You're locked. Cuz even if we can't run, you can still
walk. And if you can't walk, you can crawl. Just keep moving forward. Let's just keep going. I believe in you, dude.
I know you can do this. Bare markets are where we build. This is
where we eat. This is where we eat, dude. Let's get
it. Let's get it. I've never been more locked. never been more [ __ ] So, can you look
at account one and account two bots that are running? Okay, so the bots that are running here are um they're called uh
it's actually not account one and two, it's account two and three. So, account two, we didn't make any changes and it
didn't get any trades, which is interesting, but I'm not too worried about that then because maybe it's just not getting trades. Maybe look into it.
It is the hyper momentum 500k and then the liquidation acceleration which is on
account 3 also didn't get any trades. I'm a little more worried about that one. Can you make sure that everything
is functioning correctly there? We We won't worry about the liquidation_m for now. Actually, yeah. Well, no, don't
let's not worry about that one for now. It's probably going to have the same bug as the liquidation acceleration. It also
didn't take any trades when I kind of assumed it would. Um, just like debug those two and yeah, come back with a
report of what might have happened. Thank you.
Okay, so again, I'm using Whisper Flow here just so I could talk to my AI because I didn't know how to type before
I learned to code. And I spent a lot lot of time learning how to type. And it was helpful because I was able to then watch
all these videos on how to code and type everything out in order to have my
fingers learn it before I learned it. And anyways, I got my speed up to 70 words per minute, which was phenomenal
for me. But then I got Whisper Flow and I'm sure there's other dictations out
there, but I'm at 150 words per minute. So again, I will step on the gas harder than anybody else. And everything I find
I will show here live. It's not free anymore because the ops are in the chat and they're coping so so hard.
They're coping so so hard. They're like, "I can't afford the five. Why am I still trading if I can't afford five?" If you
can't afford five, don't waste your time in the YouTube chat. Everybody that's in the YouTube chat, exit the chat.
Everybody that is on the Twitter chat, everybody that is on the Twitch chat, exit the chat. Don't waste your time
here. If you can't afford five, it's not worth it. Sorry, bro.
You're cooked. You're cooked in the out. The public is cooked, dude. Can't afford
five to come into the Zoom. Just not worth it. Not worth it. If you do get into the Zoom before the end, you get
the full replay. You get the API keys, you get the quant app, you can see everybody's positions,
and you can study this training I'm giving you here today with 4.6 we're cooking.
Let's go ahead and try to find her. So, remember I had a bunch of agents
here going, but I can't find her. Where are you?
Oh, there. She's still cooking. She's still cooking. Okay, so we're going to put them next to each other.
So, I've got one agent looking at or one cloud code looking at my two two bots I
launched yesterday. I had some bug critical same bug blocked all trades. I knew it, dude. Jesus.
Debug report. Account two and three bots. Okay. Uh, verdict working fine. Account two. Let's go ahead and look at
it real quick. Yes. Okay. I agree with that. Um, the log trade shows it did take
three trades. Oh, okay. Sick. It got a plus one, plus one, and then minus two.
So, it's positive, which is good, but not very positive. The bot is
functioning correctly. It just hasn't triggered since February 5th because its filters are very strict. Needs a hype
whale with over 500k position. Okay. Okay. Account three, liquidation accelerated. Verdict: bug found. I knew
there was something there. Whale confirmation always fell. The trade has zero trades. The bug is in hype git.
Okay. It parses moonv API. Okay. But liquidation accelerate. Okay. It looks like positions. Okay. This means even
when the bot detects a valid three bar move, it gets blocked. Okay. So, that's the problem. Liquidity has the same bug.
Okay. Yeah. I want you to fix both. I want you to go ahead and fix both of them. Go ahead. Thank you. And then the
reason I'm doing this is because we set these up yesterday and I noticed they didn't get any trades, but I I would expect them to trade at least once a
day.
So, she's going ahead and fixing the bugs. And you can see I still haven't coded yet. I still haven't coded yet. If
you got good ideas and you are a trader, you have to either stop trading or you
need to automate it. And I've shown you why. You can see these back tests as well. Let's go back to those back tests
really quickly and show you why you can't use leverage. So, look at this. This one is a draw down of 13%. That
means or this one, yeah, 13%. If you use 10x leverage, you're liquidated. This one's 9% draw down. And these are
really, really phenomenal. This is a bad example for why you can't use leverage because these are phenomenal draw downs.
But you'll see draw downs of like 30%, 40%. And at 30%, that means 3x leverage you are liquidated. 3x leverage. And all
of these people are using 40x leverage. 40x4x 40x 20x 40x4x 40x4x $54 million
long here using 40x leverage. Jesus, dude. Yeah,
he's cooked. So, is he real or is he uh I know he's
real, but let's see how good he is at trade in one year. He might be like uh the exchange low key.
Okay. So, he's long $54 million and I that's a new position.
1043. So, I caught him in 6 minutes. He lo He joined six minutes ago. Um
6 minutes. 54 million. 54 million. Greedy long. Greedy long. Or is he a
[ __ ] good trader? Who knows? We'll see. But um
54 million, dude. That's a big big amount. $54 million long just entered.
six minutes ago. Dude, this is why you can't you can't compete with automated traders. You can't you can't compete
with quants. We I literally identified a 59
I called it I'm dyslexic, so I'd be messing up my numbers, but um I found a
$59 million position here within five minutes.
How can you compete with that? I know exactly when he gets liquidated. 67.
Yes. 37. 67. 37.
Oh my god. He's What? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. He No. No. No. This guy is crazy for that. He gets
liquidated at 6737. Oh, yeah. Okay. Good night. I think he
gets I think he gets cooked on stream today. I don't know. Maybe he's a good
trader. Maybe this is just going to blast off. I don't know. I can't predict price. So, I focus my time on testing
ideas, researching ideas, and then back testing those ideas to see if they work in the past. And that's my system. So,
both fixes look clean. Here's what changed. Mundep. Okay, beautiful. So, I
could go ahead and reset that then. Lake acceleration. Okay, I knew something was
going on here because this should have been cooking. Should have been cooking yesterday.
Should have been cooking. Okay. So,
beautiful.
Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful.
Okay, we got those two things fixed. So, let's see how these back tests are doing. Robustness tests. So, there's
seven robust. There's seven different AI agents working for me and they could be working for you.
Could be working for you cuz you get everything I get at the same time because you got Amazon funding all this.
You got Nvidia funding all this. So see what happens over time.
Wow. MCR is up 15%. Don't run with the pack. If everyone is trying to solve the
same problem or a whole group of people, that's the latest and greatest thing to do. Don't do that. Do something
original. Don't follow the pack.
Do something original. That was Jim Simon saying, "Don't trade by hand.
Stop trading by hand." Okay? You know how to research. You know how to back test. You know how to find ideas. Oh,
but this won't work for me because what, dude? What? What reason? What's in your mind? Why can't this work for you? Why
can't you be a quant starting now? You don't know how to code. That's okay. AI codes for you.
You don't have any good ideas. That's okay. I gave you 100 plus sources, 100 plus books you could read. Podcast, if
you just want to listen, that's fine. You don't believe in yourself? Well, please don't trade by hand. Then I think
you do believe in yourself. I think you do have some good ideas in your brain.
Come on, tell me why you can't do it. I'll show you you can. And I've already given you the data, a literal data
source that nobody else has in the chat. Moonv.comdata or actually docs.
I built the hyperlquid data layer so I'm able to get data multiple seconds faster
than you can on the API. And I can get data like everybody's positions here and you can too. So you have that API key.
You can go to moonab.com/doccks right now. If you're here live, I give that out for people that come to the
lives because you guys are actually locked. You guys are actually the people that I want to I want to work with and I
want to build with. So I want to go ahead and show you the last part of this. I told you I'd show you three things. Showed you I would tell you I'd
show you how to research and find new ideas. I showed you how to back test those ideas. See if they actually work
in the past. If they work in the past, you can build another bots in the future. Okay, so
she's cooking. Okay, let's see what she does. But now I want to show you how to build a bot.
Four out of four. Okay, nice, dude. So, two of them passed essentially. There's
these different tests you can run like walk forward testing, permutation test.
And you can see the first two pass. They're ready.
Metrics table. So add a sample test.
Shuffle beat. Which is good that they don't beat. Walk forward, add a sample. All four
folds. Okay. So do I walk forward is good. Again, I don't want to overconfuse you, but I'm just doing this as I am on
year five. All profitable. Yes. Yes. Yes. Wow, dude. Key findings here. Best
overall low stable par. Okay, DC11. So, this is Calman plus
Donian and this is consecutive plus Calman. Mostly robust trade with caution.
Okay, so I mean to me it looks like the first two, the DC08 and DC11 are the
only two to run. go ahead and um
update this February folder. It should be in the back test where you put a MD
showing this data here for how it did and the robustness tests for those top
two and explaining them shortly and concisely in layman's terms.
So then I can go ahead and implement them later. Put this in the GitHub. make the read me very or the
the read for this strategy these two strategies very short concise data with filled with data so I can just go ahead
and build it out when I'm ready and I push all this to GitHub because
people on my team get this you guys some of you guys not all you guys but some of
you guys that are actually locked in the Discord in the members area in the community a lot of you guys get this
because I can research I and back test. I could build bots, but I'm only one person still. So, if I can get it to you
guys, some of you guys will frontr run me. You think this is an interesting idea? Okay. Well, you are getting all
that data. I'm pushing it to GitHub right now. Well, she's done. I'm trying to make it
short and concise. This is what we tested. This is where it is. You have
access to it in the GitHub. This is war, dude. This is war. It's
PvP. So,
it's weird that I show you all this. It's It's weird. But Jim Sims literally just said says, "Don't do what everybody
else is doing." Everybody else is running a scarcity model in their brain when it comes to trading, Wall Street,
Quant, all that. They're all like, "Oh, I can't share anything cuz I'll lose my edge." But I'm I'm
approaching it the exact opposite because I'm not going to do what everybody else is going to do because I see everybody else get liquidated. So
I'm not trading by hand and I'm not listening to the big heads. I have literal funds and other quants in my DMs
saying stop sharing this stuff. I just say [ __ ] off, dude. I'm going share everything. Changed my life. And you
know what changed my life? Learning that I could actually code and then learning to code. That changed my life. I believe
code's a great equalizer. I don't give a [ __ ] about leaking edge. I don't give a [ __ ] I want to leak my edge because I
want to show people ambitious people who don't know how to code. I want to show that, hey, you can use these AI tools to
code anything. You don't need to pay a developer ever again.
Believe code's a great equalizer. I believe once you learn how to code, you can say [ __ ] off to anybody cuz you could build for the rest of your life.
The rest of your life. Doesn't matter what color you are. Doesn't matter where you live. Doesn't matter if you're a good coder, you're a good coder.
Everybody's a great coder. Now, if you can learn the basics, if you learn the basics of coding, you become a great coder because we have Opus 4.6. Let's
get it. 30 files added to back testing. Double confirm. Okay. So,
I want you to push this fold. Let's go ahead and see here. Mund trading bot. So, this is the GitHub.
Um, let's go ahead and open this up actually. Code dot
Okay, so Hyperlid here. Let's go back to the back test here.
Got a lot in this GitHub. So much f. Yeah, I wanted here. Copy path.
So, this is a bot that should be working now. Where are you, girl? Okay, here you are.
I want you to put everything in the February 26 folder.
So, just move all of that work that we just did right now with the liquidations
double confirm in that folder with the RB and all that. Okay. And then I'm going to push it to GitHub so you guys
have access to it.
Okay. Let's build out those couple bots. I want to build out two bots right now. So, it's as simple as this, but this used to take weeks. Used to take weeks.
What I'm about to do here is it used to take weeks, dude. So, are you too late to get started? No, you're not. You're
actually the perfect tire because we have AI that can code for us.
All right, I want to build two new bots here and underscore them somehow so I know the difference. Um, okay. The first
bot I want you to go ahead and essentially I want you to find the aggregated total, the bigger side,
longer lick or shorts near lick for hype. long sneer lick or shorts near lip lick for height. You find the aggregated
total of both sides, but this is the difference from the other aggregate we did. We're looking for the aggregated
total. Which side is bigger? Okay, let's say that there's more longs in that 2% aggregated total. Say there's a billion
dollars of longs and there's only $200,000 of shorts. Okay, so longs,
right? But the quirk for this bot is we're actually going to be looking for the
biggest gap
between price and liquidation. Ah, this is tough to explain to you. So, let's start with this bot. Let's just build
this bot first and then we'll move on to the second one. You're going to have to ask me questions back because I'm having a hard time formulating my idea here.
But I'm looking for the biggest gap in liquidations.
Meaning if there's like $100 million in liquidations here and 2% and they are up
to the price of $39, that's where the last person gets liquidated of that huge bunch. Okay? and then there's a gap and
there's not a big liquidation until $42. Measure that gap size 39 to 42. Okay?
And then also do that with the other licks, the long licks, the long licks and the short licks. And then we were trying to figure out which side of
liquidations has the bigger gap also which side of liquidations has more
liquidation opportunity. Okay. And then we'll just simp simply put a bot where that like if we're
trying to go long, we'd buy we'd buy a dip and then stay long until those those people got liquidated
and then the reverse for short and we would sell before that gap of price. So
the thought process here and you'll have to ask me questions in order to understand this entirely but the thought process here is everybody gets
liquidated but the price will move towards the
bigger bunch of liquidations. So whether we should be long or short should be told by that. If there's more shorts
then we should buy a dip and go long. But if there's more long buy a dip or buy a rip and go short or sell a rip
and then we'd close. You have to at the price before that gap assuming
they're just going to get that gap and then move back. You see what I'm saying? So ask me any questions you have. Keep improving the system
because other parts of it are going to wear out after a while. People will catch on to this or they'll catch on to
that. So you you just have to like in any business like in any business, you just have to make things better and better and
better. That's what everyone else is trying because that's what everybody else is going to do. They literally lock in for 4 hours a day and do exactly what I'm
showing you how to do today. And that was Jib Simons who did exactly what we're doing today to round up a net worth of $31 billion. Please, please,
please, dude. Throw a one in the chat if you believe that you can do this, too. A one in the chat if you believe you can
do this, too. And if you can't,
if you don't believe you can do this, then you're wasting your time here. Let's be honest. One, Kelly knows. Let's
get it. Let's get it, Kelly. Okay, we got we got one person locked. Let's get it.
Okay, we got some we got Weezy lock. We got Dalia un locked. Okay, one in the chat if you if you believe you could
automate your trading. We got Dunkke. I see you, bro. Thank you. Okay, cool,
cool, cool. Well, I'mma lock it with you guys. I I'm doing this for you guys. I'm doing it for for Tibby. I'm doing it for
Jacob. Let's get it. Let's get it. So, I want her to go ahead and ask me
any questions because you saw you heard what I tried to explain to her and I don't have I don't have the intellectual
ability in order to communicate well enough my idea right now. So, I'm going
to let her ask me any questions she has. But that's the thing. You can't stop me. I can only stop me.
I can't stop you. You can only stop you. You're the If you're sleeping in all day, like you're not excited about this
stuff. That's your problem, not mine. I'm excited. Let's get it. Let's get it,
dude. That's all you need. All you need is energy and a vision. If you can see it in your mind's eye, you can have it.
You can have anything. Okay. For clustering liquidations, how
far from current price should we look? The liquidation mm bot uses 2% zones.
Should this bot scan a wider scale to find the full cluster gap? Yeah,
should Yeah, it should look at probably about 20%. But really, that's not a limit
we're looking at, right? We're looking for the biggest gap in those clusters
assuming that the market is going to liquidate that cluster and then come back and liquidate that cluster and the
times we will close the positions will be at the end of the cluster. So
probably 20%. Right? Because hype moves 10 20% a day. Um but really that's not
it doesn't matter. It might even be 40%, 30%. We're We have to identify those
clusters.
Okay. Should we define a gap? What minimum price? This is
dynamic. It should be dynamic as in we're looking
for the bigger one, right? So where is the bigger gap
long or short?
So for entry when the bot determines the direction go long because of more long legs. How should it enter limit?
If it's trying to go long it's going to wait for three red bars. No, let's say. Yeah,
it'll wait for If it's trying to go long, it's going to
wait for one red minute bar. One red five minute bar.
If it's trying to go short, it's going to wait until there's one
5m minute green bar and then it's just going to loop until it's entered on limit. So, we won't pay any fees because
I'm using extended exchange that has no fees if you use limit orders. But if you
are going to be a human about this, then you're going to use market orders and pay all the money in the world. Which
account should this run on? Let's go ahead and look at those real
quick. Think I'm going to do account one.
Maybe I'll do account two. Let's do account two. Okay. Submit answers. And I'm going to go ahead and do a review here of account two because I think I'm
going to um I don't know. I might keep it. But
we'll see. We'll see if it was fire or not. So, I'm going to go over here. And again, this is just an iteration game at
this point. Once you get over the curve of like, hey, how do you research ideas? How do you back test ideas? How do you
build bots? Well, then when you're building bots, you're building with small size and then you're just testing or seeing what the data says. Like for
example, I'm watching these bots down here. I'm watching these bots down here. I've got bots up here running. I'm
watching all these incubated bots that are small size. You know, I got 100 bucks in this account. I got 80 bucks in
this account. You don't have to use that size either. You use $10 on Hyperlid.
Good. That clarifies a lot. Let me make sure I have a full picture before I build it. What position size should the bot use?
95% of balance.
What's the stop-loss strategy?
I don't want to stop. Um 80% stop.
85% stop. I don't want a stop loss. So effectively,
just saving myself from liquidation.
and then close on the signal.
Should there be a minimum total liquidation value on the winning side?
Yes. 500K. Submit answers. Okay. She's cooking. So any any questions that she
has, she just asked them. So 4.6 Six is effective thus far.
Effective thus far.
He said, "Bro, I I started two weeks ago. I was so scared to code cuz I sucked at syntax and ADHD. So having all
this AI is like a dream." It is a dream. It's a beautiful beautiful world, dude. Beautiful world. Beautiful world, dude.
Jacob's got Hostinger, Open Claw, and Hostinger. Okay. Okay. I haven't even
gone back to OpenClaw today, so I don't know. I I'm still indifferent of Open Claw, but I'm going to keep playing with
it. Like, cloud code is just so sick. And I
want control of these systems. But that could be me being those same like 10x engineers that like, oh, AI doesn't
work. But I'm not gonna be that because I'm actually testing it, you know. And if open claw claw open claw is better
than claw code, then I'll use open claw. If clock is better, I'll use that. I'm a data dog. I don't care.
Okay, so now we're cooking up our first bot. And you've literally watched me today go from idea. I showed you how to
find ideas. I showed you how to back test. I even showed you robustness test. Dobbund have everything set in the
February 26th folder. Okay, let's go ahead and say get add dot then get add
dot get commit slash new back test
get push. What did you push it?
She did. What a dog. What a data dog.
What a data dog, dude. She push it
last week. last week. I don't think she push it. What What the heck is that?
What's going on here?
It's weird because I tried to push this to GitHub and it says there's nothing there. Oh, she already prepared it probably.
Get push.
I'm year five. I still don't know how to use GitHub. So, you're always going to learn. There's But hey, I could do
everything. If you get stuck, it's okay. It's okay, dude. You'll be all right. We literally
have her to answer everything. The remote repo has new commits that you don't have locally.
Okay. Do I push to GitHub?
Robustice plan read me brief all the ideas. So all of
the code is here and then the robustness pland. Yeah. So somebody can attack this
immediately. Uh is it going to work? I don't know. I don't know. But that's why I always recommend I incubate small
size. Small size. Okay. Let's see what this is doing over here. She cooked it yet. She's she's mustering. She says
she's mustering. She's mustering again.
I don't care how good you are in anything. You don't have discipline. You ain't nobody, right? Nothing without discipline. Cuz you give
up on the slightest struggle without discipline. 100%. Discipline. Doing what you hate to do, but do it like you love it. Doing
what you hate to do, but do it like you love it. That's that is a great quote.
Mhm. And if you can do that, you could be successful in anything. Yo, you know me. All right. So, she's building the bot
and then I'm essentially going to go ahead and test that bot here on my extended account. It's just another
exchange. They're all the same. All the same. Some have perks, some don't. I want you to be able to build anything. I
want you to build anything. I knew I know I threw a lot of information at you.
Anybody feeling like this, dude? Anybody feeling like this?
I just threw literally the whole playbook at you. The entire playbook.
The entire playbook of how to use Claude Opus 4.6 and later 5.6 and later
whatever, dude. You literally have everything I know.
So, stop being one of these guys that gets liquidated. Become a quant, which you are now. You
know everything I know. I know I just threw a lot at you today. So, if you're feeling like this, I understand.
I just wish I had this when I got started. I wish I had somebody that would just give me the RBI system when
from the start, from the jump. With AI, you could build anything. She's building. Okay, she's going to cook for
a while. throw one in the chat if you want me to go ahead and go over a special offer I put together for you.
So, you could actually take this and learn it, short, concise videos, and study it at any time you want. Throw one
in the chat and I'll go over that if you would like to hear about that. Um, essentially what what I did is I put
together a offer for you guys since you logged in for two and a half hours here
and I gave you the RBI system. This is the actual system I'm following. You can see I'm literally adding to my GitHub
literal ideas that blew my mind today. And if you want to see that, just throw one in the chat. And if I get a couple
ones, I'll go ahead and spend a little bit of time to go over that. That's special for you.
And anybody that already has the GitHub, you have access to those groundbreaking
back tests that we found today. So, thank you. Thank you for kicking it. Um,
apologize for going so so hard, but um, I'm gonna have her build this in the background because she's going to take a
while and then I'll since I got a bunch of ones in the chat, I will go over that offer here. U, this is just because
you're in here for two hours, whatever. Um, nobody else sees this. Nobody else sees
this. So, please keep this stuff to yourself.
Okay. So, what you're going to get here is you're going to get the algo trade camp and you can Google this right now.
You can see all the people that have had success. I've been able to transfer my exact stepbystep
process via short concise videos that I put together in a six-w weekek training.
And I'll show you step by step how to automate your trading even if you've never coded before. You saw plenty of examples today how I didn't even code,
but I shipped more than I shipped in the first 3 years. That's crazy. Maybe not
three years, but you get the point. It used to take me eight hours a day to back test one back test. And I I back
tested 20 different ideas today. 20. It would have taken weeks. I'm going
to show you exactly how to do all of this. how to come up with ideas, how to then back test those ideas, how to
robustness test those ideas. Even if you don't know how to code, even if you don't have any ideas right now, if
you're a trader trading by hand, again, you have two options. Either stop trading or automate it. Because if you
automate it, you must look your strategy in its face. Are you trading a strategy that's profitable? Yes or no.
So, you don't have to go through the five years of hard work that I went through, four hours a day, usually like
six. You don't have to go through those struggles because everything I figured
out I just I just teach you in the go trade camp. Like I said, you could Google it, see reviews and stuff. Helped
hundreds of people that found me just like you did searching for a better way to trade. I
commend you for that. You're the data dog. You found me.
You just logged in for two full hours and learned my entire system.
So, if you want short, concise videos plus code that holds your hand through the process
of automating your trading, that's what you get in the Algo Trade Camp. It's revolutionary because you go from
stressfilled, anxietyfilled, losing trader to fully automated
to fully automated. You don't have to ever click buy or sell ever again.
You know, you'll only trade systems that actually work because you have my whole system. You know how to back test. You
know how to find great ideas. And you know how to implement them. Let me ask you this. If all the trade camp did, if
all it did was help you build one profitable trading bot, would it be worth $3,000?
Yes, of course. If that dude would have taught me for three G's, what? He didn't teach me
anything. But I would have paid him I would have paid him 30 G's. I would have paid him 50 G's. The dude that inspired
me would have done anything. So now you don't have to go through the
trials and tribulations and literal five years of work in order to know what I know. I'm going to let you download all
of my knowledge in the next couple weeks. You'll learn in two weeks. It's
been extended to six weeks simply because I'm locked with you, dude. I'm not some guru that just did this in the
past and is trying to sell you a course that of something I did in the past. No, dude. locked right now and that's why it
started with 15 days and it's now 60 plus days. You'll learn everything in the first 15 days. All the other stuff
is bonus. So I don't want you to get overwhelmed here. But this is a revolutionary package
with the algo trade camp because I can take any hand trader and help you fully automate it. But I'm also going to give
you more. I'm going to give you the AI master classes, these AI master classes. Like I said, I was dogged for the first
couple years that I was just an AI coder, but I was in there in the weeds when we used to have to copy and paste
from chatebt over here over to your terminal like over to your Visual Studio
Code, copy paste. It was a pain. But guess what? I've been I've been perfecting my craft for since the day
the AI launched. Like there's nobody ahead of me in AI coding.
And I'm going to teach you everything I know about AI. Let AI do the heavy lifting. So, even if you don't know how to code, don't worry. You don't know how
to code, that's fine. We got AI and I'll show you exactly how to use AI. So, that's at least $1,000 value. But on top
of that, like I said, you know, I hit Hyperlid in 2023. Everybody that was in the ALGO trade camp in 2023 got
absolutely off. I got so many DMs saying they made life-changing money because they were trading on Hyperlquid in 2023
during their alpha. 2024, same thing. We're right on the
wave. Solana memecoins went freaking crazy and we got off on it
because we were building bots for Solana. I built a copy bot. I bought built a sniper bot
and that whole process took me 6 months a year. I make it so easy for you here
with the Solana and Copybot and Sniperbot course. So you don't have to go try to figure that out. No, I'm just
going to show you shortly and concisely exactly how to do this. How to build for Salana, how to build for Hyperlquid, how
to build for Coinbase, how to build for Binance. Wherever you want to trade, you'll be able to trade by the end of this. And on top of that, I'm going to
show you how to build for Poly Market. So, Poly Market is fascinating. There are unlimited new markets available.
You're going to be able to build for anything. You're going to be a real quant. You're not going to be stuck to some exchange. No, it doesn't matter
what exchange where the opportunity is. There's going to be arbitrage opportunities between this exchange and
that exchange. You got to be able to build for both. And I'm going to show you short and concise how to build for any exchange. And then on top of that,
you never have to pay me ever again for any of these Zoom calls. You get in for free for life. And then you get Quant
Elite, which is insane because I've been working at this industry for 5 years. And so has my team of quants. And what
we do with that work, we drop it in the quant elite section.
So people are paying right now $300 a month for this. And you could see why because there's hundreds if not
thousands of back tests and bots and scripts and things that help you as a
quantitative trader. I could just scroll forever. I could scroll forever, ever, ever.
And you get access to all of this right now. was 300 plus bots to back test and new code added every single week. So
people are paying $3,564 a year. And you get access right now just because you stuck with me through
this training here today. You get access to everything for life.
For life. Any new drop. Anything. This is a lifetime access. As long as I'm chasing Jim Simons and I'm sharing
stuff, I'm dropping new code, new data, new APIs, new courses, dude. like you
get access for life. You could see why this is a $13,000 value, right? Because
if it just helped you become a profitable trader, wouldn't that be worth $13,000?
Of course,
I'm not afraid to die on a treadmill. You might have more talent than me. You
might be smarter than me. But if we get on the treadmill together, right, there's two things. You're getting off
first. Yeah. Or I'm gonna die. It's really that simple.
So, you know, you could do this with me or against me. Either way, uh I don't care. I I I know what works better for
me. I have the data. I was a hand trader trading with with emotions and now I'm a
profitable algorithmic trader. So it's just like I wasn't profitable as a hand trader. Sure, I'd have like 30 days good
days, but then one day just blow up. What happened at the 1.5 billion of
people yesterday. So it's still happening and it's going to happen every single day. So you can choose to
do this quantitatively and I'll show you absolutely everything I know over the course of next 15 days and I will give
you access to every single training I have on AI. Every single training I have on building on Solana, every single
training I have on building on Poly Market, every single Zoom call, you never have to pay me again. And every single thing I've done in the past, you
get access to everything. This is a lifetime pass, but I want to make it even better. I want to make it even better.
And I actually have to update the website to may even have it be open because it's not open yet. So,
can you go ahead for the slashgo page that is also connected to the slashin
page? Go ahead and set that to close at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time. So, right now
it's closed because it's past, but make it February 6th, 11:00 a.m. Eastern.
That will open the cart up and set the timers on both pages.
So, let me go ahead and get that going. But you all you you guys are the only
ones in the world that have access to everything I know. And it's the only way
to learn from me other than these Zooms. But these Zooms, I'm usually stepping on
the gas. I'm building, building, building. Today, Opus 4.6 dropped. And I
dropped heat with Opus 4.6 already. Well, she dropped the heat. Let's be honest. I came with ideas.
And she dropped the heat. You can see bot one is done now. So let's see here. Got it. I have a clear picture now. Let
me summarize the full strategy before I build. Liquidation gap bot v1. I rates all hype logs lick bigger size equals
price will go there. Market hunts liquidity as find the biggest gap in
that side's liquidation cluster. TP edge of the cluster where the fuel runs out.
entry you wait for a pullback candle red five minute okay then limit order okay
SL 85% of margin just saving from liquidation signal flip close in direction
changes while in position account 2 10x 95 okay beautiful bot one is done core
logic here analyze liquidation gaps pulls all hype positions from Mundev API
beautiful aggates longs versus shorts finds the biggest gaps in each cluster
direction bigger side entry waits for a fivem minute candle. Okay. Exits TP at gap edge. Okay. So,
I'm going to go ahead and write this down because now I have to launch this. This is on account two, but I'll launch
it here in a few after I'm done explaining all this here
to you. Go ahead and launch that.
So, every day we're just getting better and better and better. Okay, she's updating the website here,
so it will work. But this is what you're going to get. Okay, perfect. So, this closes at 11:00
a.m. So, you do have a chance to get this. Um, it closes at 11:00 a.m., though. So, 11:00 a.m. Eastern is about
35 minutes from now. So, you do need to make a quick decision as this is not for
everybody and I do not want to work with indecisive people. I have everything you need to know in order to automate your
trading even if you don't know how to code and I teach you that shortly and concisely in the algo trade camp. I give you AI the AI master classes and I
actually even pay for some of your AI inside the discord. I teach you exactly how to build so a lot of bots market
bots. I give you unlimited access. You never have to pay me for anything ever again including these zoom calls. You also get Quant Elite, which has 5 years
of actual code and new code added every single week. Plus, it's lifetime access to everything. So, this is lifetime
access. You never have to pay for anything. If you ever see me drop anything, boom, you get it free. But on
top of that, you get the Moondev vault. I've shown you this already here today. The Moonva is sick because YouTube
literally made me take this stuff down. I can't show this stuff to anybody else. You're the only people that have access
to this. It's two terabytes. two terabytes of videos. You can watch it anytime. Get all cozy on the the plane
with your little blankie, dude. I don't care. Download the videos, send it to your AI. I don't care. It's yours. Get
the boot vault 100 plus deleted live streams. On top of that, you get the API key. It's a literal $10,000 value
because if you go to Coin Glass, they would charge you $900 a month
for 12 days of data. I give you 18 months of past liquidation data. Plus, you get the API key, so you can
literally see everybody's positions. Don't you think you'll be able to trade better?
Of course. Of course. You get my training bot GitHub. You saw
me push to that GitHub today. All those crazy ideas that Opus 4.6 came
up with. Are you kidding me? Time time is flying because this stuff is accelerating. So, if you want access to
all that code and anything that I launched, you get two GitHubs. You get the AI agent GitHub as well, the
training by GitHub and the AI agent GitHub. You're a quant now, so you need this GitHub. You get it for free as a
bonus. AI agent GitHub. Literally the most exciting thing in the world right now, AI agents. You get my swarm, you
get everything. You can plug the swarm into any anything
and it will be helpful. But on top of that, you get Quant app access. So you can see Quant app here.
It has allowed me all day to see everybody's positions. So, if I could see everybody's
positions, don't you think I'll be able to trade better? Don't you think my bots are going to appreciate being able to see everybody's positions?
Of course they're going to appreciate that, dude. Of course, they're going to be like, "Yo, Moon, thank you.
Thank you. Now, I can go ahead and build bots based off of people's positions." And that's what Wall Street does. They
see where you're at and they they liquidate you straight up. That's it.
They just try to liquidate everybody. Everybody gets licked. Everybody gets licked. If you're long
with 40x leverage, you're getting licked. If you're short with 40x leverage, you're getting licked. That's
because they can see your positions. If I can see your positions, what else can they see? You know, and by the way, that
guy got out of the market. Let's see what happened to him. So, he had a $59 million short here or
long. He sold it. So, he was in and out. But
nobody else knows that except you and I because if you came to the Zoom today,
you got the API key until tomorrow or until next time I'm here. Every single
day. I not every I'm not committed to giving you the key every single day. Of course not. This is You see how valuable
this key is? The API key is worth $10,000. I'm not giving that to you every single day. I'm
sorry. And there's no subscription to get it. There's nothing to get it. There's no other way to get it except
this lifetime package or every once in a while I'll give it to you in the chat. So, I think the $5 Zoom is um pretty
good deal already. But here's the API key just in case. And if you have any questions, let me know. put them in the
chat because I will answer everybody's questions. But you only have 28 minutes here to decide if you actually want to
step on the gas with me and automate your trading. If you're just so so if you're just a dabbler, you just spend three hours watching something and then
leave and do the whole thing, that's fine. Can't control that. I don't care.
But for those that do want to get started, of course, this is a $48,000 value because your five years of work is
worth $48,000, right? or would you rather have five years?
Like what is your five years worth is the question? Not going to charge you that. I could do
50% off. I could do 75% off and still be a great deal. I mean,
if you got one profitable trading bot, if you built one profitable training bot from what I taught you, is it worth
12,000 bucks? Of course, dude. Of course.
Of course, bro. course is worth $12,000. Of course, I would have paid double that. Of course,
I'd pay $7,500, dudes. Of course, you have to. You have to. If you actually
want to attack this industry, you have to purchase somebody's knowledge or you're just going to be fiddling,
fuddling around for so long trying to figure it out, and you're just going to waste your life.
You're just going to waste your life. I'm not going to charge you all that. I want you to get in because you are actually locked. So, 97% off. It's 1,500
bucks. You can go to moonundab.com/go in order to join. This is the link for
lifetime access. You get everything that's on your screen. I'll answer any questions you have. I'll drop the link
in the chat and that's it. If you have any questions, please let me know.
Please let me know. It's mundave.com/go. So you can literally go there right now.
Mundave, your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. com/go. You
go to mundab.com/go. You scroll down, you see everything. You get here and then you see hundreds of people just
like yourself that found me somewhere on YouTube or Twitter and
they joined and they've had success. You can read exactly what they say. Just go
here, mudab.com/go. Click there. It's 1,500 bucks. Money replenishes you. Your money always comes
back to you. You're spending too much money on Uber Eats. I know I do. Just save that. You could even use CLA.
We take cards, CLA, crypto, Cash App, whatever.
You get everything. You get all the code in my GitHub. So, somebody asked if you get the code for trading on Dexes. I
trade on Hyperlquid. I trade on I show you how to build on Hyperlquid. If
that's what you're referred to by DEX, if you're referred to onchain Solana stuff, yes, I show you exactly how to
build onchain Solana. You can get it for as low as $72 per month for 24 months.
But don't take credit unless you're actually going to step on the gas. I told you I spent $2,000
on a course when I was 21 years old with no money and I put on a credit card. And then I spent $15,000 on top of that on
an app that did didn't do well, but it forced me to build a system that made me
a lot of money. So, I put it at $1,500 because if a mundave in college broke as
[ __ ] could do this and pay 2,000, like you could pay 15.
It's an investment. That's how you have to look at it. It's an investment and a new approach to trading. You could say goodbye to the old way of trading. Say
goodbye to those all night painful staring at the charts hoping you're not going to get liquidated just so you can
go get liquidated after having less sleep because you could have just gone to sleep and got liquidated. But you had to stare at the charts to get
liquidated. You don't have to do that anymore. I want you to say goodbye.
You have two options. You can close the chat right now. Never come back. Don't come back to the zooms. Don't come back
to the chat. Don't come back, dude. And just go just go be a hand trader still. You hear the bullets. Longs get shorts.
Longs get licked and shorts get licked. Everybody gets liquidated,
especially right now. So, if we are going into a bare market and you're going to trade by hand, you will lose
all of your money. And you know that because we sit here all day and we watch these guys get licked and then these
guys get licked and these guys get licked and then these guys get licked. That means the math ain't math in me. If
you're using mad leverage, you're cooked. You're wasting your time. You're wasting your life. You can change your
life here today. It's one payment at 1,500. And if you can't for some reason come up with this with a credit card,
anything you have, then go ahead and do the two payment plan. But like I said, do not use a credit card unless you're
actually going to step on the gas. I've told you my story. I used a credit card to learn some information I didn't know and I needed to know. I spent $2,000 and
I made it happen. But that's cuz I'm a data dog. So if you're actually a data
dog, yes, you can pay half now and half later. Exactly. Dalia asked if they
could pay half now, half later. You can pay half now and half later. 797 now,
797 later. It's a little bit more than 1,500 because I'm holding your debt.
There's a 90-day money back guarantee as well, which is very unique because you don't see that often, right? Especially
on digital products. But I I'm a big believer. I'm a big believer in guarantees. I don't want your money. I
want your mind. I want to be around people that can elevate me. So, if I put a
guarantee on there, that's really great because then I don't have to worry about worry about you. Like, if if it's not
for you, it's not for you. You can have your money back, no questions asked. So, I know there's a little pressure here. You got 22 minutes to join,
but don't feel pressured because you can go make an informed decision.
Go see what's in the offer. You see, you get the algo trade camp. I show you step by step how to automate your trading. Go
see if it's for you. If it's for you, okay, let's get it. If it's not, just get your money back. 90 days, no
questions asked. You can see all of the reviews. A lot of people mention the guarantee like, damn, he's not capping
about the guarantee. I actually got my money back. No questions asked. I'm so shocked. I know I'm a random dude on the
internet. So, that's what I want to do. I want to give you a 90-day money back guarantee. You see me here on YouTube
every single day. I'm not going anywhere. So, if you actually want to automate
your trading, I'm going to hold your hand step by step in the algo trade camp and then I'm going to show you how to
use AI to go to anything. You saw everything I built today. I built 20 back tests and a full bot. That would
have taken me months. This is the perfect time. But the information alone is not going
to help you. You need step-by-step videos. You need the actual code if you actually want to save your time. Sure, I
I taught you a lot today. I told I gave you my actual system, the RBI system. Let's go. You could use that and you can
go like play play around in this industry and try to figure it out. You at least have a system that I didn't
have when I got started. So, I'm happy I was able to give that to you today. But let's say that's going to save you two
years. If you want to save five years, you want to save five years, you have to
get this lifetime access. You can see what everybody has to say about it. I know. I'm going to gas it up to be the
best thing ever. Of course, I built it. I think it is the best thing ever. I would have paid $50,000 for this. This
value is not fake. People are actually paying $3,564 right now for Quant Elite because it's
new code every single week. And I've been doing that for multiple years with my team of three other quants. So, four
of us times like four or five years of posting in Quant Elite. That's a lot
of value in there that you get instantly today. Yes, everything is instant today. You get all access to everything and
then anything I drop in the future, you get access to.
You need time, Eigor. You absolutely need time. And everybody has every every excuse in the world. Like, if you're a
full you've got a full-time job, that's fine. Like, you might not be able to compete with me. It is what it is. you
got a full-time job and you don't want to spend four hours a day on this. Like, yeah, of course you're not going to get as good results as I do.
So, it's just like, you know, we all could say every single reason in
the world why you can't do it, but this is for the people that know that they can't. They can find an hour here, hour
there. I think you're one of them. You're here. Give me a couple months, he says. Okay, that's fine. That's fine.
You got 19 minutes and then you got three months of a refund, money back
guarantee. So that's what I would suggest is if you are on the fence and
you can't get started for two months, well, you got 90 days to get your money back. So while it's here,
I'm not keeping it. You guys think I'm going to keep giving you this offer of lifetime. You think I'm crazy, bro? This
is lifetime access to everything I've built and everything in the future. So
yeah, I wouldn't I wouldn't sleep here. I wouldn't sleep on this lifetime. I know
you zoo I know you zooies have seen it a couple time, but and I know you're gamblers. I get that. You're gambling
on, oh, will it be here next week? No, might be. But all I can tell you is
this, dude. In 18 minutes, you will not be able to get access to this. Will it ever come back? I don't know. I don't
know. There's plenty of people in the boot camp. There's plenty of people on my team. Now,
obviously, I I made it an investment. I made it I could have I could have made it super super inexpensive and taught
you like a 100th of what I actually teach you. But I thought like the best way to approach this was to get people
on my team, get them caught up to speed with me. Give them 100% of what I know instead of doing something that's like
99 bucks and teaching you like 1% of what I know. Like that's stupid. I I
gave you that today. I hope today was worth the $5 that you paid for the Zoom.
But you got this. You got 90 full days to to make an informed decision because at the end of the day, you don't want to
be a uninformed buyer. So that's why I really love this 90-day money back
guarantee because when I went and bought that PlayStation 5 and the lady said, "We'll take back a half and Costco dog."
I was so secure in the buy. I was like, "Damn, I could go see if I actually want to keep this."
And the first time I did it, I returned it because they have such a guarantee. So you could return it as well if it's
not worth it to you. But I think it's going to be worth it to you if you're if you're trading by hand. Uh and if
anything opened up your eyes today, you know, you could either go back to that hand trading, that stressed out life, or
you can become an automated trader. You know, I got held back in the seventh grade. My my teacher sat me down, my
home room teacher sat me down, said, "Man, I don't think you're going to make it around here." That was [ __ ] up at
its first meeting. What you mean I'm not going to make it around here? That feels off to me.
Her compromise was allowing me to make it around here if if I stay back another
year. So, I got held back in seventh grade. So, there's no excuse for anybody
that actually wants to do this. You can have the API key for today. Here
it is. It's in the chat.
So, if you're still on the fence, now now is the time. Exists in all of us. It's very simple.
This is what I believe and I'm willing to die for it.
Period. Period. Dude, period. Period. I'm willing to die for this, dude. I'm willing to die for it. And everything I
find out, I will give to lifetime members. So, if you get this, if you get
access today, you have access for life. So imagine if I'm here for three more
years. Well, if I find out something new, I'll build like a course for it.
I'll I'll go deep. If I find something that is fire, like for example, the Salana, copy bot, and sniper course.
That's just because I found something fire and it was printing cash for me. So I had to teach my family. You guys are
my family. Everybody else is an op. So I built into the copy course and the
sniper course. Oh, I found something that printed on Poly Market. So, I built out four different bots so you can learn
and build out your own ideas on Poly Market. Nobody else shares this information. Whatever's next, guess
what? You're going to get access to it. Cuz I'm here to blow up Wall Street. I'm
here to demystify the whole like, oh, you have to go to Harvard. You have to be a PhD. All that [ __ ] dude. [ __ ]
these all boys club. You can't do this or that because you don't live in America. [ __ ] America, dude.
I had somebody tell me that the other day. They said, "Oh, you're not even qualified to speak because you live in the Philippines." What type of [ __ ]
is that? It's crazy. I believe code is a great
equalizer. I learned to code and I don't have to say I don't have to talk to anybody. I can say [ __ ] you to
everybody. That's the beautiful thing because code like once you have that in your bag, you can build wealth for the
rest of your life. The way I looked at it when I got started was, hey, I could I'm I'm
emotional trading right now. I'm losing money. I need to automate my trading. But there's a hurdle here. I have to
learn how to code. So, I I justified it by, hey, if I learn how to code, at worst, I can go get a job at Google. But
at best, I can have automated trading systems. I'm grateful that I've been able to get to this point to be fully
automated. But the worst case scenario was I learned a hard skill that I could build
for the rest of my life and I just been spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on developers. I just replaced all of them. I don't need them anymore.
Idea guys are going to get off in this in this next decade too because now we
don't even really need to know how to code. I think you need to kind of know how to code. So I teach you how to code in the algo trade game for regular
people. Not some [ __ ] like big head super smart person. Just regular people. Just regular people. So, if you're like
a big head smart guy that knows absolutely everything and knows this won't work for you, like you've already
made your decision. I can't help I can't help you, dude. I
think you got to look at the glass half full. But I think most of you that are in the Zoom, I know the public, they're all skeptical of everything. They're
skeptical of everything. Their skepticism is always going to keep them being losers at the end of the day.
Cuz think about it like this. If you've been here for two, three hours, like you're very interested in this industry.
And then I try to give you the whole kitchen sink. Everything I know in short, concise, consumable videos. It's
not overwhelming. I hold your hand from a place of, "Hey, I never coded before either, so I can relate. I was scared to
code, too. I can relate. I got held back in seventh grade."
I mean, hopefully you can't relate, but we all got our trials and tribulations, dude. Uh, [ __ ] man. It's
just like we all got liquidated. We all We all have been liquidated before. I
can say that. And you've been here for two, three hours, so like I know you're ready to do this.
Just don't be one of those dudes that just is too skeptical of everything
always. I That money back guarantee is for that person, right? It's like now you can make an informed decision like
let the ego aside. Not everybody's a bad guy. Some people
authentically like to share and build a life of abundance. And that's just my
bet. My bet is that all these big head quants and Wall Street guys that are telling me not to share this, they're
just scared. They're scared because I show so much so freely
that what's going to happen? Well, it's already happened, but we're
just getting started. The tribe of us moon devs is already bigger than some
firms. So, what's going to happen in 5 10 years? I don't know. If you want access to everything lifetime, that's
that's where you're going to get it. That's where you're going to get it. Slime peace slime, appreciate it. I
forked ideas and made them my own. There we go. Forkked ideas and made them my
own. So you could have every single idea I have, every single piece of code, the
exact step-by-step training on exactly how to go from emotional hand trader to
fully automated trader. That's what's going to happen. It's revolutionary in the algo trade camp. I'm going show you
step by step. Go to moundev.com. You have 10 minutes. So moonv.com/go
mundave.comgo. You can see everything that you get here. There's two payment options, 1,500
or two payments of 797. You can use CLA as well. That will get your payments down to about 72 bucks a
month. That's quite amazing. You can use crypto.
You can use card. You can use Cash App.
We got money makers and we got excuse makers. Please pick the right path.
Money is good. It's just a tool. Everybody gets so weird about like hoarding their money, but then they'll go trade it with 40x leverage. Like
you're literally giving money away when you use leverage. So stop hoarding that money, saving it for the casino. If
you're going to hoard that money, use it on education. Money is just a tool of exchange.
It's all it is. Somebody knows something you don't know.
You better invest in that. Unless you're not actually serious about this.
If you're not serious about automating your trading, okay, that's one thing. But we all have disposable income.
Most people just go paycheck to paycheck and I don't have a disposable income and they just spend it. They spend it all on
drinks and food and just stupid stuff that doesn't actually give you any edge in life. If you allocate just a portion
of that going out budget or whatever, you allocate a portion of that to education, you can actually advance in
life. That's how I've made all my advances in life. Every business I've ever got into, like the app business, I
bought the knowledge from somebody because it took their two, three years,
and I bought it for 2,000 bucks. I'm giving you five years for 1,500.
Damn near 15 years later, it should be 5 $10,000. And look,
everybody says this to me every day. They're like, "Raise your prices. Everybody else is trying to sell stuff
for $9,000, $10,000, $12,000 in the financial industry." And I should,
but I think code is the great equalizer. And if you're actually locked, you can afford 1,500.
Money always comes back to you and you have proof of that. You've been down bad before and then the money comes back
somehow. because you're a data dog and there's unlimited time to test anything in your life and you can build forever
especially if you learn how to code. I will show you how to code and then I'll show you how to utilize all this AI so
you can build for the rest of your life. What's the worst case scenario? You go through this, you learn exactly how to
code. You learn how to build anything with AI. Best case scenario is you have fully automated trading systems for the
rest of your life, right? But the worst case scenario is you know how to code and you can build for the rest of your life and you can say f off to anybody
that gives you any [ __ ] for anything. Like if you don't like your job anymore, peace.
Peace, dude. You guys got seven minutes. If you do want to jump in if you have any questions, let me know. I will answer all of them.
Could you hit me with the API keys? Absolutely. So if you guys want a lifetime API key, join the lifetime
access because you do get the API key for life. You don't have to jump into these streams and I won't have the API
key for free forever. I've had a lot of people already hit me up asking for like a subscription to the API key in Quant
app. They found certified edges, which is awesome to hear. You're using my API
that I give you for free to find an edge. That's amazing. But people are asking me to put a subscription. I'm not
doing that. I'm chasing Jim Simons, the $ 31 billion man. I can't have 18
products. I got one product and then a private stream. My one product is lifetime all access. You get access to
everything I know. All videos, all code, all trainings, all future stuff.
Everything I have to offer, you get access to. But you have seven minutes,
6 and a half minutes. There's a 100% money back guarantee. There are thousands of people I've
helped. You can see hundreds of reviews. People say I have saved their life to
change their life to so many things. You just read read them, dude. Read them. If you have time, you got six minutes. I
will be turning off this stream. I will be turning off everything. The page will automatically turn off at the end of
this six minutes. And I know this is a little rushed, but you have a 90-day money back guarantee. So, you can check
everything out. And if it's not for you within the next 90 days, you get your full refund. No questions asked.
No questions asked. You can read through all of these reviews here. I knew I was going to make it. I just
know how this world is what you make it. You
create your own environment. It all starts with a vision. What you can imagine you can create.
So, are you going to make money or are you going to make excuses? That is the question I'm going to leave you off
with. If you have any more questions, I have answers. But that's the question
I have for you because we all have excuses. We all got a lot on our plates.
I get it. We all think it's too hard to to code. We got Opus 4.6 now. Are you
kidding me? Then it's going to be 4.7. Then it's going to be 4.8. Then it's going to be 7.2. And then Dude, it's
over. It's over. It's over. It's over. It's our time to shine. And I'm trying
to get you cop to speed with me as quickly as possible.
So you can go to moonundev.com/go see everything you get. You get the algo trade camp where I'm going to show you
step by step how to automate your trading. Even if you've never coded before, it's okay. I didn't know how to
code either. So I'm a able to actually relate to you and walk you through that process. as somebody who is scared of
learning how to code, so I don't go like super nerdy on you. Like they the developers like are it's kind of
like a all boys club as well. It's like, oh, you're not smart enough to be a coder. That's what I always felt like
when I talked to a developer. It was like, oh, I'm better than you. Yeah, you wouldn't be able to do this. Oh, yeah.
I, you know, whatever. It's just like, okay. That's how I felt until I was 30 years old and I had to learn how to
code. So, it's just I don't know about you, but Anthony is in. He said, "I
signed up. Let's get it, bro. Let's go." I'm excited to build with you, dude. If
you have any questions along the way, we'll be in the Discord. There should be an instructions page on that back end
with the first part of training. And if you have any um
yeah, you'll have to send over your Discord and whatnot to to that email there. I'm subscribed to the course
currently. How much different is everything in this course? Well, you get the algo trade camp. And if you got that
uh legacy version, you may only have 15 days. There's six weeks now. There's 63
days. You also get the AI master classes, which if you're a legacy, you
may not have. You get the Salana Copybot course and the trade sniperbot course. I
just don't know what your subscription is, but um subscriptions are absolutely cooked here. And it's just too hard to
manage for from my side to have like a algo trade camp, AI master classes, salana, have all these different
products when I'm literally chasing the hardest goal in the world. So I just made one lifetime access and I built
this for people like you. I built this offer for members because I am very
cognizant of you guys. You guys are paying me $3,500 each year for my code
in Quantite. So, I thought like, hey, how can I make this for the people that
actually want to lock in for life? How could I make the best offer ever? So, you can ignore everything on your
screen, every all the bonuses, everything you get. You get the vault, you get the API key, you get the GitHub,
you get the other GitHub, you get Quant app. All of these these are real values. This is what I'm going to sell to Wall Street for 12,000, 5,000. Go buy it
right now if you're on the fence, by the way, because you have two minutes and I'm ending the stream. This is closing.
Everything's gone in two minutes. So, if you are on the fence, I might not be able to explain the differences. I would get it now because I built it for this
yellow block. For the people that are paying me $300 a month or $3,564
a year, what could I do to to give them the best deal ever because
I see their commitment. They're paying $3,000 a year. Well, I could do half price and give you lifetime. So, if I'm
here for five years, you get Quantite for life. So, if you're just a old school subscriber of Algo Trade Camp,
you don't have Quantite or even if you do have Quantite, this offer is for people that's already paying me $3,000 a
year. So, if you're seeing this and you've never paid me anything, like this is the
most goated offer ever. You get what everybody that's already been paid gets, but for the same price. So, it's 1,500
or two payments of 797. Uh there is only one minute left and I do not control this anymore. So uh if you want in, go
get it. At least get the page open. Get the Stripe link open. I think that's a hack if you do need five more minutes.
But I don't control it from here. I'm closing everything. The page will close automatically. You'll see it. I'll end the stream as well.
Let me in the Discord. Let's get it, dude. the Solana Bot setup. There's a lot of
videos on Solana. Remember that took me like six months to a year to build all that. So, if you do have the vault, you
can go watch those videos. There's a bunch of Solana videos there. It's worth
it. Trust the process. All gas, no breaks. Let's get it, dude. Let's get it. So, that's what everybody's saying.
I mean, the reviews say similar things. They say it's worth it. And I, you know,
I could pitch you guys on this all day, but at the end of the day, listen to what other people have to say. Don't listen to me. Go find your own ideas.
You have my system now. Much love to you guys. Thank you for coming through today. This is the end. As you will see,
the page closes in 12 seconds, 10 seconds. Go to moonab.com/go. Grab the stripe link at if you need four
minutes because it's over. 777. Mark's in there as well. Let's get it. Much
love to you guys. I will see you in the next stream. And anybody that joined the lifetime today, you get in for free for
every stream. Welcome to the family. I'm just excited. I'm excited. I'm
excited that we're going to be able to lock in together for for life, bro. So,
Jim Jim, we're chasing you, dude. And now we have an even sicker team. So,
much love to everybody. Have a beautiful afternoon, and I'll see you in the next one.
